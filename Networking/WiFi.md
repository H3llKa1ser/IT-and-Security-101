# Wireless Networking (WiFi)

### Wireless networking is a popular method of connecting corporate and home systems because of the ease of deployment and relatively low cost. It has made networking more versatile than ever before. Workstations and portable systems are no longer tied to a cable but can roam freely within the signal range of the deployed wireless access points. However, with this freedom comes additional vulnerabilities.

### Wi-Fi range is generally wide enough for most homes or small offices, and range extenders may be placed strategically to extend the signalâ€¯for larger campuses or homes. Over time the Wi-Fi standard has evolved, with each updated version faster than the last.  

### In a LAN, threat actors need to enter the physical space or immediate vicinity of the physical media itself. For wired networks, this can be done by placing sniffer taps onto cables, plugging in USB devices, or using other tools that require physical access to the network. By contrast, wireless media intrusions can happen at a distance.
