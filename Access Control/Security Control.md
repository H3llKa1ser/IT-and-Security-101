# Security Control Definition

### A control is a safeguard or countermeasure designed to preserve Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of data. This, of course, is the CIA Triad.  

### Access control involves limiting what objects can be available to what subjects according to what rules.

### One brief example of a control is a firewall, which is included in a system or network to prevent something from the outside from coming in and disturbing or compromising the environment. The firewall can also prevent information on the inside from going out into the Web where it could be viewed or accessed by unauthorized individuals.
