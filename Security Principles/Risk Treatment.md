# Risk Treatment

### Risk treatment relates to making decisions about the best actions to take regarding the identified and prioritized risk. The decisions made are dependent on the attitude of management toward risk and the availability — and cost — of risk mitigation. The options commonly used to respond to risk are:

#### 1) Risk Avoidance

#### 2) Risk Acceptance

#### 3) Risk Mitigation

#### 4) Risk Transfer
