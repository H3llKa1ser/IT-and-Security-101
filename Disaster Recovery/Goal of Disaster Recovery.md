# DRP Goal

### Disaster recovery planning steps in where BC leaves off. When a disaster strikes or an interruption of business activities occurs, the Disaster recovery plan (DRP) guides the actions of emergency response personnel until the end goal is reached—which is to see the business restored to full last-known reliable operations.

### Disaster recovery refers specifically to restoring the information technology and communications services and systems needed by an organization, both during the period of disruption caused by any event and during restoration of normal services. The recovery of a business function may be done independently of the recovery of IT and communications services; however, the recovery of IT is often crucial to the recovery and sustainment of business operations. Whereas business continuity planning is about maintaining critical business functions, disaster recovery planning is about restoring IT and communications back to full operations after a disruption.
