# Azure Cloud Shell

Azure Cloud Shell is a browser-based shell tool that allows you to create, configure, and manage Azure resources using a shell. Azure Cloud Shell support both Azure PowerShell and the Azure Command Line Interface (CLI), which is a Bash shell.

You can access Azure Cloud Shell via the Azure portal by selecting the Cloud Shell icon

Azure Cloud Shell has several features that make it a unique offering to support you in managing Azure. Some of those features are:

1) It is a browser-based shell experience, with no local installation or configuration required.

2) It is authenticated to your Azure credentials, so when you log in it inherently knows who you are and what permissions you have.

3) You choose the shell youâ€™re most familiar with; Azure Cloud Shell supports both Azure PowerShell and the Azure CLI (which uses Bash).
