# Data handling and data life cycle

### Data itself goes through its own life cycle as users create, use, share and modify it. Many different models of the life of a data item can be found, but they all have some basic operational steps in common. The data security life cycle model is useful because it can align easily with the different roles that people and organizations perform during the evolution of data from creation to destruction (or disposal). It also helps put the different data states of in use, at rest and in motion, into context. Let’s take a closer look. 

### All ideas, data, information or knowledge can be thought of as going through six major sets of activities throughout its lifetime. Conceptually, these involve: 

#### 1) Create: Creating the knowledge, which is usually tacit knowledge at this point.

#### 2) Store: Storing or recording it in some fashion (which makes it explicit).

#### 3) Use: Using the knowledge, which may cause the information to be modified, supplemented or partially deleted.

#### 4) Share: Sharing the data with other users, whether as a copy or by moving the data from one location to another.

#### 5) Archive: Archiving the data when it is temporarily not needed.

#### 6) Destroy: Destroying the data when it is no longer needed.

## Data handling practices

### 1) Classification: Businesses recognize that information has value and others might steal their advantage if the information is not kept confidential, so they classify it. These classifications dictate rules and restrictions about how that information can be used, stored or shared with others. All of this is done to keep the temporary value and importance of that information from leaking away. Classification of data, which asks the question “Is it secret?” determines the labeling, handling and use of all data. 

### Before any labels can be attached to sets of data that indicate its sensitivity or handling requirements, the potential impact or loss to the organization needs to be assessed. This is our first definition: Classification is the process of recognizing the organizational impacts if the information suffers any security compromises related to its characteristics of confidentiality, integrity and availability. Information is then labeled and handled accordingly. 

### Classifications are derived from laws, regulations, contract-specified standards or other business expectations. One classification might indicate “minor, may disrupt some processes” while a more extreme one might be “grave, could lead to loss of life or threaten ongoing existence of the organization.” These descriptions should reflect the ways in which the organization has chosen (or been mandated) to characterize and manage risks.  

### The immediate benefit of classification is that it can lead to more efficient design and implementation of security processes, if we can treat the protection needs for all similarly classified information with the same controls strategy. 

### 2) Labeling: Security labels are part of implementing controls to protect classified information. It is reasonable to want a simple way of assigning a level of sensitivity to a data asset, such that the higher the level, the greater the presumed harm to the organization, and thus the greater security protection the data asset requires. This spectrum of needs is useful, but it should not be taken to mean that clear and precise boundaries exist between the use of “low sensitivity” and “moderate sensitivity” labeling, for example. 

## Data Sesnitivity Levels and Labels

### Unless otherwise mandated, organizations are free to create classification systems that best meet their own needs. In professional practice, it is typically best if the organization has enough classifications to distinguish between sets of assets with differing sensitivity/value, but not so many classifications that the distinction between them is confusing to individuals. Typically, two or three classifications are manageable, and more than four tend to be difficult. 

#### 1) Highly restricted: Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could possibly put the organization’s future existence at risk. Compromise could lead to substantial loss of life, injury or property damage, and the litigation and claims that would follow.

#### 2) Moderately restricted: Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could lead to loss of temporary competitive advantage, loss of revenue or disruption of planned investments or activities.

#### 3) Low sensitivity (Internal use only): Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could cause minor disruptions, delays or impacts.

#### 4) Unrestricted public data: As this data is already published, no harm can come from further dissemination or disclosure.
