# Logical/Technical Access Controls

### Whereas physical access controls are tangible methods or mechanisms that limit someone from getting access to an area or asset, logical access controls are electronic methods that limit someone from getting access to systems, and sometimes even to tangible assets or areas. Types of logical access controls include: 

#### 1) Passwords

#### 2) Biometrics (implemented on a system, such as a smartphone or laptop)

#### 3) Badge/token readers connected to a system

### These types of electronic tools limit who can get logical access to an asset, even if the person already has physical access.
