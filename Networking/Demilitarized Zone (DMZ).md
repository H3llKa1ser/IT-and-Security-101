# Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)

### Network segmentation is also an effective way to achieve defense in depth for distributed or multi-tiered applications. The use of a demilitarized zone (DMZ), for example, is a common practice in security architecture. With a DMZ, host systems that are accessible through the firewall are physically separated from the internal network by means of secured switches or by using an additional firewall to control traffic between the web server and the internal network. Application DMZs (or semi-trusted networks) are frequently used today to limit access to application servers to those networks or systems that have a legitimate need to connect.
