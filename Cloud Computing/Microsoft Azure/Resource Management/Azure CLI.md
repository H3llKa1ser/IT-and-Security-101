# Azure Command Line Interface CLI

The Azure CLI is functionally equivalent to Azure PowerShell, with the primary difference being the syntax of commands. While Azure PowerShell uses PowerShell commands, the Azure CLI uses Bash commands.

The Azure CLI provides the same benefits of handling discrete tasks or orchestrating complex operations through code. It’s also installable on Windows, Linux, and Mac platforms, as well as through Azure Cloud Shell.

Due to the similarities in capabilities and access between Azure PowerShell and the Bash based Azure CLI, it mainly comes down to which language you’re most familiar with.
