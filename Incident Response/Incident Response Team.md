# Incident Response Team

### Along with the organizational need to establish a Security Operations Center (SOC) is the need to create a suitable incident response team. A properly staffed and trained incident response team can be leveraged, dedicated or a combination of the two, depending on the requirements of the organization. 

### A typical incident response team is a cross-functional group of individuals who represent the management, technical and functional areas of responsibility most directly impacted by a security incident. Potential team members include the following:

#### 1) Representative(s) of senior management

#### 2) Information security professionals

#### 3) Legal representatives

#### 4) Public affairs/communications representatives

#### 5) Engineering representatives (system and network)

### Team members should have training on incident response and the organizationâ€™s incident response plan. Typically, team members assist with investigating the incident, assessing the damage, collecting evidence, reporting the incident and initiating recovery procedures. They would also participate in the remediation and lessons learned stages and help with root cause analysis.

### Many organizations now have a dedicated team responsible for investigating any computer security incidents that take place. These teams are commonly known as computer incident response teams (CIRTs) or computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs). When an incident occurs, the response team has four primary responsibilities:

#### 1) Determine the amount and scope of damage caused by the incident

#### 2) Determine whether any confidential information was compromised during the incident.

#### 3) Implement any necessary recovery procedures to restore security and recover from incident-related damage.

#### 4) Supervise the implementation of any additional security measures necessary to improve security and prevent recurrence of the incident.
