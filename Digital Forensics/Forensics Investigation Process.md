## 1) Identification:

### Locard's Principle of Exchange: When a crime is committed, the attacker takes something and leaves something behind. What they leave behind can help us identify aspects of the responsible party.

## 2) Preservation:

### Chain of Custody must be well documented

### A history of how evidence was 

#### 1) Collected

#### 2) Analyzed

#### 3) Transported

#### 4) Preserved

### Necessary because digital evidence can be manipulated so easily

### Hashing algorithms are used to show the integrity of the evidence has not been modified by the investigation process.

## 3) Collection

###  1) Minimize handling/corruption of evidence

### 2) Keep detailed logs of your actions

### 3) Do not exceed your knowledge

### 4) Follow organization's security policy

### 5) Capture an accurate image of the system

### 6) Ensure actions are repeatable

### 7) Work Fast ( digital evidence may have a short lifespan)

### 8) Work from volatile to persistent evidence

### 9) DO NOT run any programs or open any files on the infected system until a forensic copy of the disk has been made!!!
