# Controls Assessments

### Risk reduction depends on the effectiveness of the control. It must apply to the current situation and adapt to a changing environment. 

### Consider a scenario where part of an office building is being repurposed for use as a secure storage facility. Due to the previous use of the area, there are 5 doors which must be secured before confidential files can be stored there. When securing a physical location, there are several things to consider. To keep the information the most secure, it might be recommended to install biometric scanners on all doors. A site assessment will determine if all five doors need biometric scanners, or if only one or two doors need scanners. The remaining doors could be permanently secured, or if the budget permits, the doors could be removed and replaced with a permanent wall. Most importantly, the cost of implementing the controls must align with the value of what is being protected.  If multiple doors secured by biometric locks are not necessary, and the access to the area does not need to be audited, perhaps a simple deadbolt lock on all of the doors will provide the correct level of control.
