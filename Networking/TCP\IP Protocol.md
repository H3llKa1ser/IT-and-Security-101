# Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)

### The OSI model wasn’t the first or only attempt to streamline networking protocols or establish a common communications standard. In fact, the most widely used protocol today, TCP/IP, was developed in the early 1970s. The OSI model was not developed until the late 1970s. The TCP/IP protocol stack focuses on the core functions of networking.  

### The most widely used protocol suite is TCP/IP, but it is not just a single protocol; rather, it is a protocol stack comprising dozens of individual protocols. TCP/IP is a platform-independent protocol based on open standards. However, this is both a benefit and a drawback. TCP/IP can be found in just about every available operating system, but it consumes a significant amount of resources and is relatively easy to hack into because it was designed for ease of use rather than for security. 

### At the Application Layer, TCP/IP protocols include Telnet, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP), and Domain Name Service (DNS).

### The two primary Transport Layer protocols of TCP/IP are TCP and UDP. TCP is a full-duplex connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a simplex connectionless protocol. In the Internet Layer, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used to determine the health of a network or a specific link. ICMP is utilized by ping, traceroute and other network management tools. The ping utility employs ICMP echo packets and bounces them off remote systems. Thus, you can use ping to determine whether the remote system is online, whether the remote system is responding promptly, whether the intermediary systems are supporting communications, and the level of performance efficiency at which the intermediary systems are communicating.
