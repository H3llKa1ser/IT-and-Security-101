# Degree of knowledge

### 1) Zero knowledge: The team does not have any knowledge of the target and must start from ground zero

### 2) Partial Knowledge: The team has some information about the target

### 3) Full knowledge: The team has intimate knowledge of the target

### 4) Blind test: Assessors only have publicly available data to work with. The network security staff is aware that this type of test will take place

### 5) Double-blind test: Blind test to the assessors and network security staff IS NOT notified

### 6) Targeted Test: Focused tests on specific areas of interest. Example, befoer a new application is rolled out, the team might test it for vulnerabilities before installing it into production
