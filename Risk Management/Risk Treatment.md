# Risk Treatment

### Risk treatment relates to making decisions about the best actions to take regarding the identified and prioritized risk. The decisions made are dependent on the attitude of management toward risk and the availability — and cost — of risk mitigation. The options commonly used to respond to risk are:

#### 1) Risk Avoidance

#### 2) Risk Acceptance

#### 3) Risk Mitigation

#### 4) Risk Transfer

### Avoidance: Risk avoidance is the decision to attempt to eliminate the risk entirely. This could include ceasing operation for some or all of the activities of the organization that are exposed to a particular risk. Organization leadership may choose risk avoidance when the potential impact of a given risk is too high or if the likelihood of the risk being realized is simply too great.

### Acceptance: Risk acceptance is taking no action to reduce the likelihood of a risk occurring. Management may opt for conducting the business function that is associated with the risk without any further action on the part of the organization, either because the impact or likelihood of occurrence is negligible, or because the benefit is more than enough to offset that risk.

### Mitigation: Risk mitigation is the most common type of risk management and includes taking actions to prevent or reduce the possibility of a risk event or its impact. Mitigation can involve remediation measures, or controls, such as security controls, establishing policies, procedures, and standards to minimize adverse risk. Risk cannot always be mitigated, but mitigations such as safety measures should always be in place.

### Transfer: Risk transference is the practice of passing the risk to another party, who will accept the financial impact of the harm resulting from a risk being realized in exchange for payment. Typically, this is an insurance policy.
