# Gopher Protocol

### Gopher is a TCP/IP application layer protocol designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents over the Internet. It was developed in the early 1990s and predates the World Wide Web, presenting information in a hierarchical, text-based format. Although it has largely been supplanted by the HTTP protocol and web browsers, many libraries (such as libcurl) support an overly permissive number of protocols, including gopher.
