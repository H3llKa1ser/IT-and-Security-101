# Federated Authentication

When you choose this authentication method, Microsoft Entra ID hands off the authentication process to a separate trusted authentication system, such as on-premises Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), to validate the user's password.

The authentication system can provide other advanced authentication requirements, for example, third-party multifactor authentication.
