# What is Microsoft Defender for Cloud?

Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP) with a set of security measures and practices designed to protect cloud-based applications from various cyber threats and vulnerabilities. Defender for Cloud combines the capabilities of:

1) A development security operations (DevSecOps) solution that unifies security management at the code level across multicloud and multiple-pipeline environments

2) A cloud security posture management (CSPM) solution that surfaces actions that you can take to prevent breaches

3) A cloud workload protection platform (CWPP) with specific protections for servers, containers, storage, databases, and other workloads

## Protect cloud workloads

Proactive security principles require that you implement security practices that protect your workloads from threats. Cloud workload protections (CWP) surface workload-specific recommendations that lead you to the right security controls to protect your workloads.

When your environment is threatened, security alerts right away indicate the nature and severity of the threat so you can plan your response. After you identify a threat in your environment, you need to quickly respond to limit the risk to your resources.

## Defender for Cloud planning and operations

The key areas to consider when planning to use Defender for Cloud are:

1) Security Roles and Access Controls

2) Security Policies and Recommendations

3) Data Collection and Storage

4) Onboarding non-Azure resources

5) Ongoing Security Monitoring

6) Incident Response

### Security Roles and Access Controls

Defender for Cloud uses Azure role-based access control (Azure Role-based access control), which provides built-in roles that can be assigned to users, groups, and services in Azure. When a user opens Defender for Cloud, they only see information related to resources they have access to. Which means the user is assigned the role of Owner, Contributor, or Reader to the subscription or resource group that a resource belongs to. In addition to these roles, there are two roles specific to Defender for Cloud:

1) Security reader: a user that belongs to this role is able to view only Defender for Cloud configurations, which include recommendations, alerts, policy, and health, but it won't be able to make changes.

2) Security admin: same as security reader but it can also update the security policy, dismiss recommendations and alerts.

When planning access control using Azure Role-based access control for Defender for Cloud, make sure you understand who in your organization needs access to Defender for Cloud the tasks they'll perform. Then you can configure Azure Role-based access control properly.

### Security Policies and Recommendations

Defender for Cloud automatically creates a default security policy for each of your Azure subscriptions. You can edit the policy in Defender for Cloud or use Azure Policy to create new definitions, define more policies, and assign policies across management groups. Management groups can represent the entire organization or a business unit within the organization. You can monitor policy compliance across these management groups.

Before configuring security policies, review each of the security recommendations:

1) See if these policies are appropriate for your various subscriptions and resource groups.

2) Understand what actions address the security recommendations.

3) Determine who in your organization is responsible for monitoring and remediating new recommendations.

### Data Collection and Storage

Defender for Cloud uses the Log Analytics agent and the Azure Monitor Agent to collect security data from your virtual machines. Data collected from this agent is stored in your Log Analytics workspaces.

#### Agent

When automatic provisioning is enabled in the security policy, the data collection agent is installed on all supported Azure VMs and any new supported VMs that are created. If the VM or computer already has the Log Analytics agent installed, Defender for Cloud uses the current installed agent. The agent's process is designed to be non-invasive and have minimal effect on VM performance.

If at some point you want to disable Data Collection, you can turn it off in the security policy. However, because the Log Analytics agent may be used by other Azure management and monitoring services, the agent won't be uninstalled automatically when you turn off data collection in Defender for Cloud. You can manually uninstall the agent if needed.

#### Workspace

A workspace is an Azure resource that serves as a container for data. You or other members of your organization might use multiple workspaces to manage different sets of data that is collected from all or portions of your IT infrastructure.

Data collected from the Log Analytics agent can be stored in an existing Log Analytics workspace associated with your Azure subscription or a new workspace.

In the Azure portal, you can browse to see a list of your Log Analytics workspaces, including any created by Defender for Cloud. A related resource group is created for new workspaces. Resources are created according to this naming convention:

1) Workspace: DefaultWorkspace-[subscription-ID]-[geo]

2) Resource Group: DefaultResourceGroup-[geo]

For workspaces created by Defender for Cloud, data is retained for 30 days. For existing workspaces, retention is based on the workspace pricing tier. If you want, you can also use an existing workspace.

If your agent reports to a workspace other than the default workspace, any Defender for Cloud Defender plans that you've enabled on the subscription should also be enabled on the workspace.

### Onboarding non-Azure resources

Defender for Cloud can monitor the security posture of your non-Azure computers but you need to first onboard these resources. Read Onboard non-Azure computers for more information on how to onboard non-Azure resources. VMs can be onboarded using Azure Arc, or the Azure portal.

### Ongoing Security Monitoring

After initial configuration and application of Defender for Cloud recommendations, the next step is considering Defender for Cloud operational processes.

The Defender for Cloud Overview provides a unified view of security across all your Azure resources and any non-Azure resources you've connected.

When you first opt in to use Defender for Cloud for your current Azure environment, make sure that you review all recommendations, which can be done in the Recommendations page.

Plan to visit the threat intelligence option as part of your daily security operations. There you can identify security threats against the environment, such as identify if a particular computer is part of a botnet.

#### Monitoring for new or changed resources

Most Azure environments are dynamic, with resources regularly being created, spun up or down, reconfigured, and changed. Defender for Cloud helps ensure that you have visibility into the security state of these new resources.

When you add new resources (VMs, SQL DBs) to your Azure environment, Defender for Cloud automatically discovers these resources and begins to monitor their security, including PaaS web roles and worker roles. If Data Collection is enabled in the Security Policy, more monitoring capabilities are enabled automatically for your virtual machines.

You should also regularly monitor existing resources for configuration changes that could have created security risks, drift from recommended baselines, and security alerts.

#### Hardening access and applications

As part of your security operations, you should also adopt preventative measures to restrict access to VMs, and control the applications that are running on VMs. By locking down inbound traffic to your Azure VMs, you're reducing the exposure to attacks, and at the same time providing easy access to connect to VMs when needed. Use just-in-time VM access feature to hardening access to your VMs.

You can use adaptive application controls to limit which applications can run on your VMs located in Azure. Among other benefits, adaptive application controls help harden your VMs against malware. With the help of machine learning, Defender for Cloud analyzes processes running in the VM to help you create allowlist rules.

### Incident Response

Defender for Cloud detects and alerts you to threats as they occur. Organizations should monitor for new security alerts and take action as needed to investigate further or remediate the attack.

Although we can't create your Incident Response plan, we'll use Microsoft Azure Security Response in the Cloud lifecycle as the foundation for incident response stages. The stages of incident response in the cloud lifecycle are:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c832b1d-c91b-471c-8b7d-9405b1c2ca8a)

You can use Defender for Cloud alerts during the following stages:

Detect: identify a suspicious activity in one or more resources.

Assess: perform the initial assessment to obtain more information about the suspicious activity.

Diagnose: use the remediation steps to conduct the technical procedure to address the issue.

Each Security Alert provides information that can be used to better understand the nature of the attack and suggest possible mitigations. Some alerts also provide links to either more information or to other sources of information within Azure. You can use the information provided for further research and to begin mitigation, and you can also search security-related data that is stored in your workspace.

Once you identify the compromised system, you can run a workflow automation that was previously created. Workflow automations are a collection of procedures that can be executed from Defender for Cloud once triggered by an alert.
