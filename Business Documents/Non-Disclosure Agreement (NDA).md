# Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)

### An NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) document is a legal contract between two or more parties that outlines confidential information shared between them and restricts its disclosure to third parties. NDAs are commonly used in business relationships, partnerships, and various other situations where sensitive information needs to be shared while maintaining confidentiality. Here's what an NDA typically includes:

# 1) Parties Involved:

 - The NDA identifies the parties entering into the agreement. This usually includes the disclosing party (the entity sharing the confidential information) and the receiving party (the entity receiving the confidential information).

# 2) Definition of Confidential Information:

 - The NDA defines what constitutes confidential information that is subject to the agreement. This can include a wide range of information, such as trade secrets, proprietary technology, financial data, customer lists, business strategies, and any other information that the parties deem confidential.

# 3) Purpose of Disclosure:

 - The NDA specifies the purpose for which the confidential information is being disclosed. This helps clarify the context in which the information can be used by the receiving party and ensures that it is not misused or disclosed for unauthorized purposes.

# 4) Obligations of Receiving Party:

 - The NDA outlines the obligations of the receiving party regarding the confidential information. This typically includes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of the information, refrain from disclosing it to third parties without permission, and use it only for the specified purpose.

# 5) Exceptions to Confidentiality:

 - The NDA may include exceptions to the confidentiality obligations, such as information that is already in the public domain, information independently developed by the receiving party, or information disclosed with the consent of the disclosing party.

# 6) Term and Termination:

 - The NDA specifies the duration of the confidentiality obligations (the term) and the circumstances under which the agreement can be terminated. This ensures that the confidentiality obligations remain in effect for a specified period and cease to apply once the agreement is terminated.

# 7) Remedies for Breach:

 - The NDA may include provisions outlining the remedies available to the disclosing party in the event of a breach of the agreement. This can include monetary damages, injunctive relief, or other legal remedies to enforce the confidentiality obligations.

### NDAs are essential tools for protecting sensitive information and safeguarding the interests of parties involved in business relationships or transactions. By establishing clear guidelines for the handling and disclosure of confidential information, NDAs help mitigate the risk of unauthorized disclosure and ensure that valuable proprietary information remains protected.
