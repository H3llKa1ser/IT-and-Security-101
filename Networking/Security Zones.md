# Security Zones

### It is common practice in network and physical security to group different security levels into different areas or zones

### Each zone is either more or less trusted than the other zones

### Interfaces between zones have some type of access control to restrict movement between zones - like biometric or guard stations - or firewalls

### In network security there is often a median zone between the internet and internal network called a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)
