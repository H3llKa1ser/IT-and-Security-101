# BCP Phases (NIST 800-34)

## 1) Project Initiation

## 2) Business Impact Analysis

## 3) Identity Recovery Strategies

## 4) Plan design and development

## 5) Testing 

## 6) Maintenance

## 7) Implementation

### Plan 1 Phases

#### 1) Obtain Senior Management's support (BCP Policy)

#### 2) Secure funding and resource allocation

#### 3) Name BCP Coordinator/Project Manager

#### 4) Develop Project Charter

#### 5) Determine scope of the plan

#### 6) Select members of the BCP team

### Plan 2 Phases

#### 1) Initiated by BCP committee

#### 2) Identifies and prioritizes all business processes based on criticality

#### 3) Addresses the impact on the organization in the event of loss 

#### 4) Establishes key metrics for use in determining appropriate countermeasuers and recovery strategy

#### 5) IMPORTANCE(relevance) vs CRITICALITY(downtime)

#### * THE BIA FOCUSES ON CRITICALITY

#### ** The Auditing department is certainly important, though not usually critical

## Metrics Determined in the Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

### Key metrics to establish

### Service Level Objectives:

#### 1) Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

#### 2) Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) (Also called Recovery Time Objective (RTO))

#### 3) Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)

#### 4) Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)

#### 5) Minimum Operating Requirements (MOR)

### Plan 3 Phases

#### 1) Facility Recovery

##### Subscription Services

##### Hot, warm, cold sites

##### Reciprocal Agreements

##### Others:

##### Redundant/Mirrored site (partial or full)

##### Outsourcing

##### Rolling hot site

### Plan 5 Phases

#### 1) Very the plan for accuracy and completeness

#### 2) Should happen once per year, or as the result of a major change

#### 3) The purpose of testing is to improve the response (NEVER TO FIND FAULT OR BLAME)

#### 4) Senior Management is responsible for ensuring the plans are tested

#### 5) The type of testing is based upon the criticality of the organization, resources available and risk tolerance

### Types of tests:

#### 1) Checklist test

##### Copies of plan distributed to different departments

##### Functional managers overview

#### 2) Structured Walk-Through (Table-Top) test

##### Representatives from each department go over the plan

#### 3) Simulation test

##### Going through a disaster scenario

##### Continues up to the actual relocation to an offsite facillity

#### 4) Parallel test

##### Systems moved to alternate site, and processing takes place there

#### 5) Full-Interruption test

##### Original site shutdown

##### All processing moved to offsite facility
