# Cloud Characteristics

### Cloud-based assets include any resources that an organization accesses using cloud computing. Cloud computing refers to on-demand access to computing resources available from almost anywhere, and cloud computing resources are highly available and easily scalable. Organizations typically lease cloud-based resources from outside the organization. Cloud computing has many benefits for organizations, which include but are not limited to: 

#### 1) Usage is metered and priced according to units (or instances) consumed. This can also be billed back to specific departments or functions.

#### 2) Reduced cost of ownership. There is no need to buy any assets for everyday use, no loss of asset value over time and a reduction of other related costs of maintenance and support.

#### 3) Reduced energy and cooling costs, along with “green IT” environment effect with optimum use of IT resources and systems.

#### 4) Allows an enterprise to scale up new software or data-based services/solutions through cloud systems quickly and without having to install massive hardware locally.
