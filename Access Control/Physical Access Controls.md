# Physical Access Controls

### Physical access controls are items you can physically touch. They include physical mechanisms deployed to prevent, monitor, or detect direct contact with systems or areas within a facility. Examples of physical access controls include security guards, fences, motion detectors, locked doors/gates, sealed windows, lights, cable protection, laptop locks, badges, swipe cards, guard dogs, cameras, mantraps/turnstiles, and alarms.

### Physical access controls are necessary to protect the assets of a company, including its most important asset, people. When considering physical access controls, the security of the personnel always comes first, followed by securing other physical assets.

### Physical access controls include fences, barriers, turnstiles, locks and other features that prevent unauthorized individuals from entering a physical site, such as a workplace. This is to protect not only physical assets such as computers from being stolen, but also to protect the health and safety of the personnel inside. 

## Types of Physical Access Controls

### Many types of physical access control mechanisms can be deployed in an environment to control, monitor and manage access to a facility. These range from deterrents to detection mechanisms. Each area requires unique and focused physical access controls, monitoring and prevention mechanisms. The following sections discuss many such mechanisms that may be used to control access to various areas of a site, including perimeter and internal security.

#### 1) Badge Systems and Gate Entry

### Physical security controls for human traffic are often done with technologies such as turnstiles, mantraps and remotely or system-controlled door locks. For the system to identify an authorized employee, an access control system needs to have some form of enrollment station used to assign and activate an access control device. Most often, a badge is produced and issued with the employee’s identifiers, with the enrollment station giving the employee specific areas that will be accessible. In high-security environments, enrollment may also include biometric characteristics. In general, an access control system compares an individual’s badge against a verified database. If authenticated, the access control system sends output signals allowing authorized personnel to pass through a gate or a door to a controlled area. The systems are typically integrated with the organization’s logging systems to document access activity (authorized and unauthorized)

### A range of card types allow the system to be used in a variety of environments. These cards include:

##### 1) Bar code

##### 2) Magnetic Stripe

##### 3) Proximity

##### 4) Smart

##### 5) Hybrid

#### 2) Environmental Design

### Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) approaches the challenge of creating safer workspaces through passive design elements. This has great applicability for the information security community as security professionals design, operate and assess the organizational security environment. Other practices, such as standards for building construction and data centers, also affect how we implement controls over our physical environment. Security professionals should be familiar with these concepts so they can successfully advocate for functional and effective physical spaces where information is going to be created, processed and stored.

### CPTED provides direction to solve the challenges of crime with organizational (people), mechanical (technology and hardware) and natural design (architectural and circulation flow) methods. By directing the flow of people, using passive techniques to signal who should and should not be in a space and providing visibility to otherwise hidden spaces, the likelihood that someone will commit a crime in that area decreases.

#### 3) Biometrics

### To authenticate a user’s identity, biometrics uses characteristics unique to the individual seeking access. A biometric authentication solution entails two processes.

##### 1) Enrollment—during the enrollment process, the user’s registered biometric code is either stored in a system or on a smart card that is kept by the user.

##### 2) Verification—during the verification process, the user presents their biometric data to the system so that the biometric data can be compared with the stored biometric code.

### Even though the biometric data may not be secret, it is personally identifiable information, and the protocol should not reveal it without the user’s consent. Biometrics takes two primary forms, physiological and behavioral.

#### Physiological systems measure the characteristics of a person such as a fingerprint, iris scan (the colored portion around the outside of the pupil in the eye), retinal scan (the pattern of blood vessels in the back of the eye), palm scan and venous scans that look for the flow of blood through the veins in the palm. Some biometrics devices combine processes together—such as checking for pulse and temperature on a fingerprint scanner—to detect counterfeiting.

#### Behavioral systems measure how a person acts by measuring voiceprints, signature dynamics and keystroke dynamics. As a person types, a keystroke dynamics system measures behavior such as the delay rate (how long a person holds down a key) and transfer rate (how rapidly a person moves between keys).

### Biometric systems are considered highly accurate, but they can be expensive to implement and maintain because of the cost of purchasing equipment and registering all users. Users may also be uncomfortable with the use of biometrics, considering them to be an invasion of privacy or presenting a risk of disclosure of medical information (since retina scans can disclose medical conditions). A further drawback is the challenge of sanitization of the devices.
