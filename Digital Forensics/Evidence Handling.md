# Evidence Handling

### Often, court rules typically do not allow hearsay or indirect information, except in exceptional cases. Hence, keeping evidence safe from tampering or damage is essential.

### The Chain of Custody records who handled the evidence and how it was protected, from when it was collected until it was presented in court, ensuring the evidence is genuine and unchanged. The general process is as follows:

#### Document everything properly
 - Record all seized items (like devices or files) as evidence.
 - Note the exact date and time of the seizure.
 - Identify who collected the evidence.
 - Detail the situation and steps followed during the seizure.
### Prevent any changes to the Evidence
#### For digital files:
 - Generally, a witness needs to vouch for the authenticity of digital files. However, business records (like server logs) can be exceptions if created due to normal 
   business activities and if the person presenting them as evidence knows them well.
 - It is crucial to show these records have remained unaltered from acquisition to court proceedings.
#### For physical devices:
 - If it's a device, unplug it instead of shutting it down normally to avoid unwanted data alterations.
 - Make a forensic disk image of the device's storage for analysis using accepted tools and write blockers to prevent altering the original data.
 - Securely hash and copy files to keep the original data safe and unchanged. Only a copy of the file or disk must be used for analysis. The original, which will be shown in court, should be kept safe. When taking the hash of the original, ensure that the hash of the copy matches it before and during court proceedings to prove the data hasn't been changed.
 - Package and label evidence securely before it is handled by the legal team presenting it in court.
