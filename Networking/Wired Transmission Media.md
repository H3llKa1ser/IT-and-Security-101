# Wired Transmission Media

## Considerations

### 1) Throughput

### 2) Distance between Devices

### 3) Data Sensitivity

### 4) Environment

## Types of wired media

### Twisted Pair: Copper wires twisted together to reduce electromagnetic interference.

#### 1) Unshielded: Susceptible to interference.

#### 2) Shielded: Uses an electronically grounded shield to protect the signal.

### Coaxial Cable: Uses a thick conductor that is surrounded by a grounding wire. Used in Cable TV.

### Fiber optic: Uses light pulses to transmit information down fiber lines insteal of electronic pulses.
