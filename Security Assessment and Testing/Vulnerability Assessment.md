# Vulnerability Assessment

### Passive evaluation of security posture and determines if known weaknesses exist

### Audits measure degree of compliance.

### Assessments look for known flaws (Unauthorized hosts, vulnerable services, weak passwords, default or misconfigured settings)

### Assessors DO NOT CORRECT PROBLEMS, they assess and report

### Vulnerability assessments should only be conducted with senior management's approval in writing
