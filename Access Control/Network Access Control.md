# Network Access Control (NAC)

### An organization’s network is perhaps one of its most critical assets. As such, it is vital that we both know and control access to it, both from insiders (e.g., employees, contractors) and outsiders (e.g., customers, corporate partners, vendors). We need to be able to see who and what is attempting to make a network connection.

### At one time, network access was limited to internal devices. Gradually, that was extended to remote connections, although initially those were the exceptions rather than the norm. This started to change with the concepts of bring your own device (BYOD) and Internet of Things (IoT).

### Considering just IoT for a moment, it is important to understand the range of devices that might be found within an organization. They include heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems that monitor the ambient temperature and adjust the heating or cooling levels automatically or air monitoring systems, through security systems, sensors and cameras, right down to vending and coffee machines. Look around your own environment and you will quickly see the scale of their use.

### Having identified the need for a NAC solution, we need to identify what capabilities a solution may provide. As we know, everything begins with a policy. The organization’s access control policies and associated security policies should be enforced via the NAC device(s). Remember, of course, that an access control device only enforces a policy and doesn’t create one.

### The NAC device will provide the network visibility needed for access security and may later be used for incident response. Aside from identifying connections, it should also be able to provide isolation for noncompliant devices within a quarantined network and provide a mechanism to “fix” the noncompliant elements, such as turning on endpoint protection. In short, the goal is to ensure that all devices wishing to join the network do so only when they comply with the requirements laid out in the organization policies. This visibility will encompass internal users as well as any temporary users such as guests or contractors, etc., and any devices they may bring with them into the organization.

### Let’s consider some possible use cases for NAC deployment: 

#### 1) Medical devices

#### 2) IoT devices

#### 3) BYOD/mobile devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones)

#### 4) Guest users and contractors

### As we have established, it is critically important that all mobile devices, regardless of their owner, go through an onboarding process, ideally each time a network connection is made, and that the device is identified and interrogated to ensure the organization’s policies are being met.
