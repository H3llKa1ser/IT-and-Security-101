# Authentication

### When users have stated their identity, it is necessary to validate that they are the rightful owners of that identity. This process of verifying or proving the user’s identification is known as authentication. Simply put, authentication is a process to prove the identity of the requestor.

### There are three common methods of authentication:

#### 1) Something you know: Passwords or passphrases

#### 2) Something you have: Tokens, memory cards, smart cards

#### 3) Something you are: Biometrics, measurable characteristics
