# Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### Identity and Access Management defines the roles and access privileges of individual users and defines the processes for:

#### 1) Identification

#### 2) Authorization

#### 3) Authentication

#### 4) Auditing

### Per ISC2, Identity and Access Management solutions "focus on harmonizing the provisioning of users and managing their access accross multiple systems with different native access control systems".

## Identity Management

### Controls the life cycle for all accounts in a system

## Access Management

### Controls the assignment of rights/privileges to those accounts

## Identity Proofing

### Precedes the creation of a user account 

### Not the same as authentication

### Requires the prospective employee to prove their identity to the employer

### Long before an employee is given a user account to identify with on the network, they have proven their identity to their employer

#### 1) Collect evidence from the applicant -> 2) Verify the claimed identity exists -> 3) Verify the claimed identity belongs to the applicant
