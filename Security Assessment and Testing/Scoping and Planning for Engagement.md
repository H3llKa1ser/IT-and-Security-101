# Scoping and Planning for Engagement

## Steps:

#### 1) Preparing

#### 2) Scoping

#### 3) Planning

## Scoping

### Determine:

 - Why pentest?

 - What to pentest?

 - What to access?

 - Compliance or Business?

 - Rules of Engagement?

 - Report to whom?

## Scoping is CRITICAL

### What if you as a pentester find data or resource that is not covered by the Scope agreement or Rules of Engagement?

## Examples:

 - See the possibility to get access to/from the original target from/to a subnet, however this subnet is not covered in the agreement?

## Make it clear: Downtime may occur!

 - What is acceptable?

 - For how long?
