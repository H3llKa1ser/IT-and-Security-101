# Biba Integrity Model

### Protecting the Sanctity of Knowledge

### 3 D's (Down Data's Dirty)

### Developed by Kenneth J. Biba in 1977 based on a set of access control rules designed to ensure data integrity

### No subject can depend on an object of lesser integrity

### Based on a hierarchical lattice of integrity levels

### Authorized users must perform correct and safe procedures to protect data integrity

## TIP: Biba is the EXACT reverse of Bell La Padula

## 3 Rules

#### 1) Simple Integrity Axiom - "no read down": A subject cannot read data from an object of lower integrity level

#### 2) Star Integrity Axiom - "no write up": A subject cannot write data to an object at a higher integrity level

#### 3) Invocation Property: A subject cannot invoke (call upon) subjects at a higher integrity level
