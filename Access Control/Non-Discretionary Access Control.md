# Non-Discretionary Access Control (NDAC)

### Non-Discretionary Access Control (NDAC) is a type of access control mechanism used in computer security that is based on predefined rules or policies rather than the discretion of individuals. In NDAC, access to resources is determined by system-wide policies set by administrators, and users have limited or no control over these policies.

### Key characteristics of Non-Discretionary Access Control include:

#### 1) Centralized Control: NDAC systems are centrally managed, with administrators establishing access policies for resources based on organizational needs and security requirements.

#### 2) Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): NDAC often employs RBAC principles, where access rights are assigned to roles within an organization, and users are then assigned to these roles. Access is granted based on the user's role rather than their identity.

#### 3) Mandatory Access Control (MAC): NDAC can also incorporate MAC, where access decisions are based on labels or classifications associated with both subjects (users or processes) and objects (files, directories, etc.). These labels determine the level of sensitivity or classification of the resource and are used to enforce access controls.

#### 4) Least Privilege: NDAC typically follows the principle of least privilege, granting users only the permissions necessary to perform their assigned tasks and restricting access to sensitive resources.

#### 5) Consistency and Predictability: NDAC ensures consistent and predictable access control across the system, reducing the risk of human error or intentional misuse.

### NDAC mechanisms are often implemented in secure operating systems, network devices, and other critical infrastructure components to enforce strict access controls and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. Examples of NDAC implementations include SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) and Windows Group Policy in enterprise environments.
