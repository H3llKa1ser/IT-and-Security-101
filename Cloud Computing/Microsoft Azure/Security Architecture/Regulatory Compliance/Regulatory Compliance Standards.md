# Regulatory Compliance Standards

The following are descriptions of compliance regulations in various industries and geographies:

## HIPAA

A healthcare application that processes protected health information (PHI) is subject to both the privacy rule and the security rule encompassed within the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). At a minimum, HIPAA could likely require that a healthcare business must receive written assurances from the cloud provider that it will safeguard any PHI received or created.

## PCI

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a proprietary information security standard for organizations that handle branded credit cards from the major card payment systems, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, and JCB. The PCI standard is mandated by the card brands and administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. The standard was created to increase controls around cardholder data to reduce credit-card fraud. Validation of compliance is performed annually, either by an external qualified security assessor (QSA) or by a firm-specific internal security assessor (ISA) who creates a report on compliance (ROC) for organizations handling large volumes of transactions, or by a self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) for companies.

## Personal data

Personal data is information that could be used to identify a consumer, employee, partner, or any other living or legal entity. Many emerging laws, particularly those dealing with privacy and personal data, require that businesses comply and report on compliance and any breaches that occur.

## Compliant foundation in Azure

To help customers meet their own compliance obligations across regulated industries and markets worldwide, Azure maintains the largest compliance portfolio in the industry, in both breadth (total number of offerings) and depth (number of customer-facing services in assessment scope). Azure compliance offerings are grouped into four segments:

1) Global

2) US government

3) Industry

4) Regional

Azure compliance offerings are based on various types of assurances, including formal certifications, attestations, validations, authorizations, and assessments produced by independent third-party auditing firms, as well as contractual amendments, self-assessments, and customer guidance documents produced by Microsoft. Each offering description in this document provides an up-to-date scope statement indicating which Azure customer-facing services are in scope for the assessment, along with links to downloadable resources to assist customers with their own compliance obligations.

The Microsoft Trust Center provides more detailed information about Azure compliance offerings. Additionally, all downloadable documentation is available to certain Azure customers from the Microsoft Service Trust Portal in the following sections:

1) Audit reports: Includes sections for FedRAMP, GRC assessment, ISO, PCI DSS, and SOC reports.
