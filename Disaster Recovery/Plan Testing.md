# Plan testing

### BCPs and DRPs must be tested to ensure they are accurate

### Types of tests include:

#### 1) Checklist test: Each participant review their section of the plan to validate that it is still accurate

#### 2) Structured Walkthrough test: Representatives from each business unit gather together to review

#### 3) Simulation test: An actual disaster is simulated

#### 4) Parallel test: Performing processing at an alternative site

#### 5) Full Interruption test: Regular operations are stopped and processing is moved to the alternate site
