### 2) Proofing: Verifies people's identities before they are issued accounts and credentials

### 3) Provisioning: Automation of all procedures and tools

### 4) Maintenance: Comprised of user management, password management, and role/group management

### 5) Entitlement: A set of rules for managing access to a resource and for what purpose
