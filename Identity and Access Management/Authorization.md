# Authorization

## Access control models (See Access control in this repo)

### A framework that dictates how subjects access objects.

#### 1) User access control technologies and security mechanisms to enforce the rules

#### 2) Supported by Access Control Technologies

#### 3) Business goals and culture of the organization will prescribe which model is used

#### 4) Every OS has a security kernel/reference monitor that enforces the access control model

## Access Control Models (ACMs)

#### 1) Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

#### 2) Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

#### 3) Role-Based Access Control  (RBAC)

#### 4) Attribute-Based Acess Control (ABAC)

#### 5) Rule-Based Access Control (RuBAC)

#### 6) Non-Discretionary Access Control (NDAC)

## Authorization principles

### Default NO access (implicit deny) - Unless a subject is explicitly given access to an object, then they are implicitly denied access.

### Principle of least privilege (Action)

### Need to know (Data access)

### Content-based VS Context-based
