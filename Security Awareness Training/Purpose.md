# Security Awareness Training Purpose

### To reduce the effectiveness of certain types of attacks (such as social engineering), it is crucial that the organization informs its employees and staff how to recognize security problems and how to operate in a secure manner. While the specifics of secure operation differ in each organization, there are some general concepts that are applicable to all such programs. 

### The purpose of awareness training is to make sure everyone knows what is expected of them, based on responsibilities and accountabilities, and to find out if there is any carelessness or complacency that may pose a risk to the organization. We will be able to align the information security goals with the organizationâ€™s missions and vision and have a better sense of what the environment is.
