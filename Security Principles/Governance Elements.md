# Governance elements

### Any business or organization exists to fulfill a purpose, whether it is to provide raw materials to an industry, manufacture equipment to build computer hardware, develop software applications, construct buildings or provide goods and services. To complete the objective requires that decisions are made, rules and practices are defined, and policies and procedures are in place to guide the organization in its pursuit of achieving its goals and mission.

### When leaders and management implement the systems and structures that the organization will use to achieve its goals, they are guided by laws and regulations created by governments to enact public policy. Laws and regulations guide the development of standards, which cultivate policies, which result in procedures.

### How are these 4 related?

#### 1) Procedures: Procedures are the detailed steps to complete a task that support departmental or organizational policies.

#### 2) Policies: Policies are put in place by organizational governance, such as executive management, to provide guidance in all activities to ensure that the organization supports industry standards and regulations

#### 3) Standards: Standards are often used by governance teams to provide a framework to introduce policies and procedures in support of regulations.

#### 4) Regulations: Regulations are commonly issued in the form of laws, usually from government (not to be confused with governance) and typically carry financial penalties for noncompliance.

## Deep Dive

#### 1) Procedures: Procedures define the explicit, repeatable activities necessary to accomplish a specific task or set of tasks. They provide supporting data, decision criteria or other explicit knowledge needed to perform each task. Procedures can address one-time or infrequent actions or common, regular occurrences. In addition, procedures establish the measurement criteria and methods to use to determine whether a task has been successfully completed. Properly documenting procedures and training personnel on how to locate and follow them is necessary for deriving the maximum organizational benefits from procedures.

#### 2) Policies: Policy is informed by applicable law(s) and specifies which standards and guidelines the organization will follow. Policy is broad, but not detailed; it establishes context and sets out strategic direction and priorities. Governance policies are used to moderate and control decision-making, to ensure compliance when necessary and to guide the creation and implementation of other policies.

#### Policies are often written at many levels across the organization. High-level governance policies are used by senior executives to shape and control decision-making processes. Other high-level policies direct the behavior and activity of the entire organization as it moves toward specific or general goals and objectives. Functional areas such as human resources management, finance and accounting, and security and asset protection usually have their own sets of policies. Whether imposed by laws and regulations or by contracts, the need for compliance might also require the development of specific high-level policies that are documented and assessed for their effective use by the organization.

#### Policies are implemented, or carried out, by people; for that, someone must expand the policies from statements of intent and direction into step-by-step instructions, or procedures.

#### 3) Standards: Organizations use multiple standards as part of their information systems security programs, both as compliance documents and as advisories or guidelines. Standards cover a broad range of issues and ideas and may provide assurance that an organization is operating with policies and procedures that support regulations and are widely accepted best practices.

#### The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) develops and publishes international standards on a variety of technical subjects, including information systems and information security, as well as encryption standards. ISO solicits input from the international community of experts to provide input on its standards prior to publishing. Documents outlining ISO standards may be purchased online.

#### The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a United States government agency under the Department of Commerce and publishes a variety of technical standards in addition to information technology and information security standards. Many of the standards issued by NIST are requirements for U.S. government agencies and are considered recommended standards by industries worldwide. NIST standards solicit and integrate input from industry and are free to download from the NIST website.

#### 4) Regulations and Laws: Regulations and associated fines and penalties can be imposed by governments at the national, regional or local level. Because regulations and laws can be imposed and enforced differently in different parts of the world, here are a few examples to connect the concepts to actual regulations.

#### The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 is an example of a law that governs the use of protected health information (PHI) in the United States. Violation of the HIPAA rule carries the possibility of fines and/or imprisonment for both individuals and companies.

#### The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was enacted by the European Union (EU) to control use of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its citizens and those in the EU. It includes provisions that apply financial penalties to companies who handle data of EU citizens and those living in the EU even if the company does not have a physical presence in the EU, giving this regulation an international reach.

#### Finally, it is common to be subject to regulation on several levels. Multinational organizations are subject to regulations in more than one nation in addition to multiple regions and municipalities. Organizations need to consider the regulations that apply to their business at all levels—national, regional and local—and ensure they are compliant with the most restrictive regulation.
