# Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)

### Virtual local area networks (VLANs) allow network administrators to use switches to create software-based LAN segments, which can segregate or consolidate traffic across multiple switch ports. Devices that share a VLAN communicate through switches as if they were on the same Layer 2 network. This image shows different VLANs — red, green and blue — connecting separate sets of ports together, while sharing the same network segment (consisting of the two switches and their connection). Since VLANs act as discrete networks, communications between VLANs must be enabled. Broadcast traffic is limited to the VLAN, reducing congestion and reducing the effectiveness of some attacks. Administration of the environment is simplified, as the VLANs can be reconfigured when individuals change their physical location or need access to different services. VLANs can be configured based on switch port, IP subnet, MAC address and protocols.

### VLANs do not guarantee a network’s security. At first glance, it may seem that traffic cannot be intercepted because communication within a VLAN is restricted to member devices. However, there are attacks that allow a malicious user to see traffic from other VLANs (so-called VLAN hopping). The VLAN technology is only one tool that can improve the overall security of the network environment.
