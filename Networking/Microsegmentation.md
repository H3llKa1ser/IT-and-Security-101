# Microsegmentation

### The toolsets of current adversaries are polymorphic in nature and allow threats to bypass static security controls. Modern cyberattacks take advantage of traditional security models to move easily between systems within a data center. Microsegmentation aids in protecting against these threats. A fundamental design requirement of microsegmentation is to understand the protection requirements for traffic within a data center and traffic to and from the internet traffic flows. 

### When organizations avoid infrastructure-centric design paradigms, they are more likely to become more efficient at service delivery in the data center and become apt at detecting and preventing advanced persistent threats.
