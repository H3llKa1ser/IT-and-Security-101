# Crossover error rate

## Type 1 Error: False Rejection (FRR):

### A legitimate user is barred from access. Is caused when a system identifies too much information. This causes excessive overhead.

## Type 2 Error: False Acceptance (FAR):

### An impostor is allowed access. This is a security threat and comes when a system doesn;t evaluate enough information.

### As FRR goes down, FAR goes up and vice versa

### The level at which the two meet is called Crossover Error Rate (CER). The lower the number, the more accurate the system.

## TIP: Iris scans are the most accurate!
