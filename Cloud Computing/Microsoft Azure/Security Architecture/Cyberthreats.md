# Cyberthreats

## Threat Landscape

Whether an organization is large or small, the entirety of the digital landscape with which it interacts represents an entry point for a cyberattack. These can include:

1) Email accounts

2) Social media accounts

3) Mobile devices

4) The organization's technology infrastructure

5) Cloud services

6) People

Collectively, these are referred to as the threat landscape. Notice that the threat landscape can cover more than just computers and mobile phones. It can include any elements that are owned or managed by an organization, or some that aren't. As you learn next, criminals use any means they can to mount and carry out an attack.

## Attack Vectors

An attack vector is an entry point or route for an attacker to gain access to a system.

Here are some examples of common attack vectors:

1) Email is perhaps the most common attack vector. Cybercriminals send seemingly legitimate emails that result in users taking action. This might include downloading a file, or selecting a link that will compromise their device.

2) Removable media. An attacker can use media such as USB drives, smart cables, storage cards, and more to compromise a device. For example, attackers might load malicious code into USB devices that are later provided to users as a free gift, or left in public spaces to be found. When they're plugged in, the damage is done.

3) Browser. Attackers can use malicious websites or browser extensions to get users to download malicious software on their devices, or change a user's browser settings. The device can then become compromised, providing an entry point to the wider system or network.

4) Cloud services. Organizations rely more on cloud services for day-to-day business and processes. Attackers can compromise poorly secured resources or services in the cloud. For example, an attacker could compromise an account in a cloud service, and gain control of any resources or services accessible to that account. They could also gain access to another account with even more permissions.

5) Insiders. The employees of an organization can serve as an attack vector in a cyberattack, whether intentionally or not. An employee might become the victim of a cybercriminal who impersonates them as a person of authority to gain unauthorized access to a system. This is a form of social engineering attack. In this scenario, the employee serves as an unintentional attack vector. In some cases, however, an employee with authorized access may use it to intentionally steal or cause harm.

## Security Breaches

Any attack that results in someone gaining unauthorized access to devices, services, or networks is considered a security breach. Imagine a security breach as similar to a break-in where an intruder (attacker) successfully breaks into a building (a device, application, or network).

Security breaches come in different forms, including the following:

1) Social engineering attacks - In social engineering, impersonation attacks happen when an unauthorized user (the attacker), aims to gain the trust of an authorized user by posing as a person of authority to access a system from some nefarious activity. For example, a cybercriminal might pretend to be a support engineer to trick a user into revealing their password to access an organizationâ€™s systems.

2) Browser attacks - Whether on a desktop, laptop, or phone, browsers are an important access tool for the internet. Security vulnerabilities in a browser can have a significant impact because of their pervasiveness.

3) Password attacks - A password attack is when someone attempts to use authentication for a password-protected account to gain unauthorized access to a device or system. Attackers often use software to speed up the process of cracking and guessing passwords.

## Data Breaches

A data breach is when an attacker successfully gains access or control of data. Using the intruder example, this would be similar to that person getting access to, or stealing, vital documents and information inside the building:

When an attacker achieves a security breach, they'll often want to target data, because it represents vital information. Poor data security can lead to an attacker gaining access and control of data. This can lead to serious consequences for the victim, whether that is a person, organization, or even a government. This is because the victim's data could be abused in many ways. For example, it can be held as ransom or used to cause financial or reputational harm.

## Attack Chain Modeling

An attack chain describes the typical chain of events during an attack that leads to organizational damage. This includes technical and nontechnical steps taken by adversaries or insiders during the attack. It's important to note that there's no single linear path for either insider risk or external attacks. There are many common elements across attacks, but each one can take a unique path.

The MCRA includes an attack chain diagram that depicts common techniques related to both external attacks and insider risks, as shown below.

The top portion of this diagram represents common steps seen in many external attacks and the Microsoft capabilities that map to each step. The bottom portion shows the insider risk leading indicators and how Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management helps quickly identify, triage, and act on risky user activity.

Most external attacks include common steps and follow common patterns that are depicted in the diagram above. Most of the variation in external attacks comes from the use of different entry points. Attacks also differ based on the different objectives of the attackers like stealing data, encrypting data, or disrupting business.

Most external attacks that result in a major incident include some form of privilege escalation using credential theft, which is mitigated by securing privileged access.

Lockheed Martin created one of the first adaptations of the 'kill chain' military concept to cybersecurity. This concept of a cybersecurity attack chain it helped mature how organizations understand attacks and plan security controls by viewing attacks as a sequential chain of events. Many organizations use the MITRE ATT&CK framework today for detailed control planning like threat detection coverage.

The diagram below describes how these relate to each other and to a simple Prepare-Enter-Traverse-Execute (PETE) model that Microsoft developed to improve communications with business leaders and nonsecurity professionals.

Attackers can choose different techniques to achieve each goal of prepare, enter, traverse, and execute objectives. Attackers may also use a combination of techniques or the same technique over and over again iteratively to achieve their objectives.

All of the security best practices in the MCRA and MCSB are intended to reduce risk of attackers succeeding. Several MCRA best practices focus directly on the security operations aspects of external attacks - detect, respond, recover.
