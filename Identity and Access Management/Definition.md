# Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### Identity and Access Management defines the roles and access privileges of individual users and defines the processes for:

#### 1) Identification

#### 2) Authorization

#### 3) Authentication

#### 4) Auditing

### Per ISC2, Identity and Access Management solutions "focus on harmonizing the provisioning of users and managing their access accross multiple systems with different native access control systems".

## Identity Management

### Controls the life cycle for all accounts in a system

## Access Management

### Controls the assignment of rights/privileges to those accounts
