# Defense in Depth

### As you can see, we are not just looking at system access. We are looking at all access permissions including building access, access to server rooms, access to networks and applications and utilities. These are all implementations of access control and are part of a layered defense strategy, also known as defense in depth, developed by an organization.

### Defense in depth describes an information security strategy that integrates people, technology and operations capabilities to establish variable barriers across multiple layers and missions of the organization. It applies multiple countermeasures in a layered fashion to fulfill security objectives. Defense in depth should be implemented to prevent or deter a cyberattack, but it cannot guarantee that an attack will not occur. 

### A technical example of defense in depth, in which multiple layers of technical controls are implemented, is when a username and password are required for logging in to your account, followed by a code sent to your phone to verify your identity. This is a form of multi-factor authentication using methods on two layers, something you have and something you know. The combination of the two layers is much more difficult for an adversary to obtain than either of the authentication codes individually. 

### Another example of multiple technical layers is when additional firewalls are used to separate untrusted networks with differing security requirements, such as the internet from trusted networks that house servers with sensitive data in the organization. When a company has information at multiple sensitivity levels, it might require the network traffic to be validated by rules on more than one firewall, with the most sensitive information being stored behind multiple firewalls.

### For a non-technical example, consider the multiple layers of access required to get to the actual data in a data center. First, a lock on the door provides a physical barrier to access the data storage devices. Second, a technical access rule prevents access to the data via the network. Finally, a policy, or administrative control defines the rules that assign access to authorized individuals.

### Defense in depth uses a layered approach when designing the security posture of an organization. Think about a castle that holds the crown jewels. The jewels will be placed in a vaulted chamber in a central location guarded by security guards. The castle is built around the vault with additional layers of security—soldiers, walls, a moat. The same approach is true when designing the logical security of a facility or system. Using layers of security will deter many attackers and encourage them to focus on other, easier targets. 

### Defense in depth provides more of a starting point for considering all types of controls—administrative, technological, and physical—that empower insiders and operators to work together to protect their organization and its systems. 

### Here are some examples that further explain the concept of defense in depth: 

#### 1) Data: Controls that protect the actual data with technologies such as encryption, data leak prevention, identity and access management and data controls.

#### 2) Application: Controls that protect the application itself with technologies such as data leak prevention, application firewalls and database monitors.

#### 3) Host: Every control that is placed at the endpoint level, such as antivirus, endpoint firewall, configuration and patch management.

#### 4) Internal network: Controls that are in place to protect uncontrolled data flow and user access across the organizational network. Relevant technologies include intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, internal firewalls and network access controls.

#### 5) Perimeter: Controls that protect against unauthorized access to the network. This level includes the use of technologies such as gateway firewalls, honeypots, malware analysis and secure demilitarized zones (DMZs).

#### 6) Physical: Controls that provide a physical barrier, such as locks, walls or access control.

#### 7) Policies, procedures and awareness: Administrative controls that reduce insider threats (intentional and unintentional) and identify risks as soon as they appear.
