# Authentication

### Proving a claimed identity

#### 1) Something you know (Password, security question, etc)

#### 2) Something you have (key, card, Yubikey, etc)

#### 3) Something you are (Retina scan, fingerprint, etc)

## The strongest authentication is multi-factor (MFA) a combination of the 2.

### Mutual authentication is desirable as well

## ANY single means of authentication can be spoofed
