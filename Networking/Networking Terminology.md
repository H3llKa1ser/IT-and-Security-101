# What is networking?

### A network is simply two or more computers linked together to share data, information or resources.

### To properly establish secure data communications, it is important to explore all of the technologies involved in computer communications. From hardware and software to protocols and encryption and beyond, there are many details, standards and procedures to be familiar with.

# Types of Networks

#### 1) Local Area Network (LAN): A local area network (LAN) is a network typically spanning a single floor or building. This is commonly a limited geographical area.

#### 2) Wide Area Network (WAN): Wide area network (WAN) is the term usually assigned to the long-distance connections between geographically remote networks.

# Network Devices

#### 1) Hub: Hubs are used to connect multiple devices in a network. They’re less likely to be seen in business or corporate networks than in home networks. Hubs are wired devices and are not as smart as switches or routers.

#### 2) Switch: Rather than using a hub, you might consider using a switch, or what is also known as an intelligent hub. Switches are wired devices that know the addresses of the devices connected to them and route traffic to that port/device rather than retransmitting to all devices.

#### Offering greater efficiency for traffic delivery and improving the overall throughput of data, switches are smarter than hubs, but not as smart as routers. Switches can also create separate broadcast domains when used to create VLANs, which will be discussed later.

#### 3) Router: Routers are used to control traffic flow on networks and are often used to connect similar networks and control traffic flow between them. Routers can be wired or wireless and can connect multiple switches. Smarter than hubs and switches, routers determine the most efficient “route” for the traffic to flow across the network.

#### 4) Firewall: Firewalls are essential tools in managing and controlling network traffic and protecting the network. A firewall is a network device used to filter traffic. It is typically deployed between a private network and the internet, but it can also be deployed between departments (segmented networks) within an organization (overall network). Firewalls filter traffic based on a defined set of rules, also called filters or access control lists.

#### 5) Server: A server is a computer that provides information to other computers on a network. Some common servers are web servers, email servers, print servers, database servers and file servers. All of these are, by design, networked and accessed in some way by a client computer. Servers are usually secured differently than workstations to protect the information they contain.

#### 6) Endpoint: Endpoints are the ends of a network communication link. One end is often at a server where a resource resides, and the other end is often a client making a request to use a network resource. An endpoint can be another server, desktop workstation, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or any other end user device.

# Other networking terms

#### 1) Ethernet: Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) is a standard that defines wired connections of networked devices. This standard defines the way data is formatted over the wire to ensure disparate devices can communicate over the same cables.

#### 2) Media Access Control (MAC) Address: Every network device is assigned a Media Access Control (MAC) address. An example is 00-13-02-1F-58-F5. The first 3 bytes (24 bits) of the address denote the vendor or manufacturer of the physical network interface. No two devices can have the same MAC address in the same local network; otherwise an address conflict occurs.

#### 3) Internet Protocol (IP) Address: While MAC addresses are generally assigned in the firmware of the interface, IP hosts associate that address with a unique logical address. This logical IP address represents the network interface within the network and can be useful to maintain communications when a physical device is swapped with new hardware. Examples are 192.168.1.1 and 2001:db8::ffff:0:1.
