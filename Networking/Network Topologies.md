# Network Topologies

## Bus

### A LAN with central cable (bus) to which all nodes connect

### ADVANTAGES

#### 1) Adding Nodes

#### 2) Node failures don't affect the rest

### DISADVANTAGES

#### 1) Bus failure

## Tree

### All devices connect to a branching table

### ADVANTAGES

#### 1) Adding Nodes

#### 2) Node failures don't affect the rest

### DISADVANTAGES

#### 1) Cable failure

## Ring

### A closed loop topology. Data is transmitted in one direction only.

### ADVANTAGES

#### 1) Maximum wait time

#### 2) Can be used as LAN or Network backbone

### DISADVANTAGES

#### 1) Single Point of Failure

## Mesh

### All nodes are connected to every other node

### ADVANTAGES

#### 1) High level of redundancy

### DISADVANTAGES

#### 1) Very Expensive

## Star 

### All nodes are connected to a central device such as hub, switch or router

### ADVANTAGES

#### 1) Few cables

#### 2) Easy to deploy

#### 3) Nodes can easily be added or removed

### DISADVANTAGES

#### 1) The central piece is a single point of failure
