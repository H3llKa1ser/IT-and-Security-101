# Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

### Discretionary access control (DAC) is a specific type of access control policy that is enforced over all subjects and objects in an information system. In DAC, the policy specifies that a subject who has been granted access to information can do one or more of the following:

#### 1) Pass the information to other subjects or objects

#### 2) Grant its privileges to other subjects

#### 3) Change security attributes on subjects, objects, information systems or system components 

#### 4) Choose the security attributes to be associated with newly created or revised objects; and/or 

#### 5) Change the rules governing access control; mandatory access controls restrict this capability 

### Most information systems in the world are DAC systems. In a DAC system, a user who has access to a file is usually able to share that file with or pass it to someone else. This grants the user almost the same level of access as the original owner of the file. Rule-based access control systems are usually a form of DAC.
