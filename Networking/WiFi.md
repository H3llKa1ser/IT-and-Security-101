# Wireless Networking (WiFi)

### Wireless networking is a popular method of connecting corporate and home systems because of the ease of deployment and relatively low cost. It has made networking more versatile than ever before. Workstations and portable systems are no longer tied to a cable but can roam freely within the signal range of the deployed wireless access points. However, with this freedom comes additional vulnerabilities.

### Wi-Fi range is generally wide enough for most homes or small offices, and range extenders may be placed strategically to extend the signalâ€¯for larger campuses or homes. Over time the Wi-Fi standard has evolved, with each updated version faster than the last.  

### In a LAN, threat actors need to enter the physical space or immediate vicinity of the physical media itself. For wired networks, this can be done by placing sniffer taps onto cables, plugging in USB devices, or using other tools that require physical access to the network. By contrast, wireless media intrusions can happen at a distance. 


#### 1) Mobility: A wireless communications system allows users to conduct business from anywhere without

#### 2) Reachability: Wireless communication systems enable people to stay connected and be reachable, regardless of their location.

### 3) Simplicity: Wireless communication systems are easy and fast to deploy in comparison of cabled network. CAUTION!: EASE OF USE IS OFTEN THE ENEMY OF SECURITY!

### 4) Maintainability: In a wireless system, you do not have to spend too much cost and time to maintain the network setup

### 5) Roaming Services: Using a wireless network system, you can provide service anywhere anytime including train, buses, airplanes etc.

### 6) Additional Services: Wireless communication systems provide various smart services like SMS and MMS
