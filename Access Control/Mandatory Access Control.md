# Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

### A mandatory access control (MAC) policy is one that is uniformly enforced across all subjects and objects within the boundary of an information system. In simplest terms, this means that only properly designated security administrators, as trusted subjects, can modify any of the security rules that are established for subjects and objects within the system. This also means that for all subjects defined by the organization (that is, known to its integrated identity management and access control system), the organization assigns a subset of total privileges for a subset of objects, such that the subject is constrained from doing any of the following:

#### 1) Passing the information to unauthorized subjects or objects 

#### 2) Granting its privileges to other subjects 

#### 3) Changing one or more security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system or system components 

#### 4) Choosing the security attributes to be associated with newly created or modified objects 

#### 5) Changing the rules governing access control 

## MAC vs DAC difference

### Although MAC sounds very similar to DAC, the primary difference is who can control access. With Mandatory Access Control, it is mandatory for security administrators to assign access rights or permissions; with Discretionary Access Control, it is up to the object ownerâ€™s discretion.
