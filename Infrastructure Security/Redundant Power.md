# Redundant Power

### Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)

## ISSUES TO CONSIDER

#### 1) Size of load UPS can support

#### 2) How long it can support this load (Battery duration)

#### 3) Speed the UPS takes on the load when the primary power source fails

#### 4) Physical space required

## DESIRABLE FEATURES

#### 1) Long battery life

#### 2) Remote diagnostic software

#### 3) Surge protection and line conditioning

#### 4) EMI/RFI filters to prevent data errors caused by electrical noise

#### 5) High MTBF values

#### 6) Allow for automatic shutdown of system
