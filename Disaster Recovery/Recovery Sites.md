# Recovery Sites 

### 1) Cold Site: A building with power, raised floors and utilities. No devices are available. (Cheapest option, but takes the longest to deploy)

### 2) Warm Site: Does not have computers but has peripherals such as disk drives, controllers and tape drives.

### 3) Hot Site: Fully configured with hardware, software and environmental needs. (Most expensive, but can be deployed the fastest)

### 4) Mobile Site: Can be deployed to any location based on the circumstances of the disaster.

### 5) Multiple Processing Sites: Supports 100% availability. Data is processed simultaneously.
