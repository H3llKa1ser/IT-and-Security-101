# Redundancy

### The concept of redundancy is to design systems with duplicate components so that if a failure were to occur, there would be a backup. This can apply to the data center as well. Risk assessments pertaining to the data center should identify when multiple separate utility service entrances are necessary for redundant communication channels and/or mechanisms.  

### If the organization requires full redundancy, devices should have two power supplies connected to diverse power sources. Those power sources would be backed up by batteries and generators. In a high-availability environment, even generators would be redundant and fed by different fuel types.
