# Defense in Depth

### As you can see, we are not just looking at system access. We are looking at all access permissions including building access, access to server rooms, access to networks and applications and utilities. These are all implementations of access control and are part of a layered defense strategy, also known as defense in depth, developed by an organization.

### Defense in depth describes an information security strategy that integrates people, technology and operations capabilities to establish variable barriers across multiple layers and missions of the organization. It applies multiple countermeasures in a layered fashion to fulfill security objectives. Defense in depth should be implemented to prevent or deter a cyberattack, but it cannot guarantee that an attack will not occur. 

### A technical example of defense in depth, in which multiple layers of technical controls are implemented, is when a username and password are required for logging in to your account, followed by a code sent to your phone to verify your identity. This is a form of multi-factor authentication using methods on two layers, something you have and something you know. The combination of the two layers is much more difficult for an adversary to obtain than either of the authentication codes individually. 

### Another example of multiple technical layers is when additional firewalls are used to separate untrusted networks with differing security requirements, such as the internet from trusted networks that house servers with sensitive data in the organization. When a company has information at multiple sensitivity levels, it might require the network traffic to be validated by rules on more than one firewall, with the most sensitive information being stored behind multiple firewalls.

### For a non-technical example, consider the multiple layers of access required to get to the actual data in a data center. First, a lock on the door provides a physical barrier to access the data storage devices. Second, a technical access rule prevents access to the data via the network. Finally, a policy, or administrative control defines the rules that assign access to authorized individuals.
