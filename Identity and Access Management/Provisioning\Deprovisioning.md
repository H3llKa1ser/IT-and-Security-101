# Provisioning/Deprovisioning

### Traditionally, different cloud vendors used non-standard provisioning APIs

### Enterprises to develop and maintain proprietary connectors to integrate with multiple SaaS providers

### Alternatively, provisioning can be managed easier through: 

#### 1) Service Provisioning Markup Language (SPML)

##### 1.1) Older, seldom implemented due to the inflexibility and lack of vendor support

#### 2) System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) or simple cloud identity management

##### 2.1) Defines a schema and an API for managing identities
