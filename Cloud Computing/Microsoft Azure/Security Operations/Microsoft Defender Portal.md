# Microsoft Defender 

Microsoft Defender XDR is a unified pre- and post-breach enterprise defense suite that natively coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, and applications to provide integrated protection against sophisticated attacks.

With the integrated Microsoft Defender XDR solution, security professionals can coordinate the threat signals that each of these products receive and determine the full scope and impact of the threat. How the threat entered the environment, what it's affecting, and how it's currently impacting the organization.

You're a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Defender XDR solutions, including Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Identity, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.

You need to see related alerts across all the solutions as one incident to see the incident's full impact and do a root cause investigation. The Microsoft Defender portal is a unified view of incidents and actions taken.

## Microsoft Defender Portal

The Microsoft Defender portal (https://security.microsoft.com/) is a specialized workspace designed to meet the needs of security teams. These solutions are integrated across Microsoft 365 services and provide actionable insights to help reduce risks and safeguard your digital estate.

You can investigate the alerts that affect your network, understand what they mean, and collate evidence associated with the incidents so that you can devise an effective remediation plan.

The Home page shows many of the common cards that security teams need. The composition of cards and data is dependent on the user's role. Because the Microsoft Defender portal uses role-based access control, different roles see cards that are more meaningful to their day-to-day jobs.

This at-a-glance information helps you keep up with the latest activities in your organization. The Microsoft Defender portal brings together signals from different sources to present a holistic view of your Microsoft 365 environment.

The Microsoft Defender portal combines protection, detection, investigation, and response to email, collaboration, identity, device, and app threats, in a central place.

This single pane of glass brings together functionality from existing Microsoft security portals, like the Microsoft Defender portal and the Office 365 Security & Microsoft Purview portal. The Microsoft Defender portal emphasizes quick access to information, simpler layouts, and bringing related information together for easier use. It includes:

1) Microsoft Defender for Office 365 - Microsoft Defender for Office 365 helps organizations secure their enterprise with a set of prevention, detection, investigation and hunting features to protect email, and Office 365 resources.

2) Microsoft Defender for Endpoint - Delivers preventative protection, post-breach detection, automated investigation, and response for devices in your organization.

3) Microsoft Defender XDR - is part of Microsoftâ€™s Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solution that uses the Microsoft 365 security portfolio to automatically analyze threat data across domains, and build a picture of an attack on a single dashboard.

4) Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps - Is a comprehensive cross-SaaS and PaaS solution bringing deep visibility, strong data controls, and enhanced threat protection to your cloud apps.

5) Microsoft Defender for Identity - Is a cloud-based security solution that uses your on-premises Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization.

6) Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management - Delivers continuous asset visibility, intelligent risk-based assessments, and built-in remediation tools to help your security and IT teams prioritize and address critical vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across your organization.

7) Microsoft Defender for IoT - Operational Technology (OT) involves the specialized hardware and software used to monitor and control physical processes in critical sectors such as manufacturing, utilities, pharmaceuticals, and more. Microsoft Defender for IoT, available within the Microsoft Defender portal, is designed to secure OT environments.

8) Microsoft Sentinel - Integrate Microsoft Defender XDR with Microsoft Sentinel to stream all Defender XDR incidents and advanced hunting events into Microsoft Sentinel and keep the incidents and events synchronized between the Azure and Microsoft Defender portals.
