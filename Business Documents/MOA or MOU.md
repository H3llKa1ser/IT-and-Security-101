# Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

### Some organizations seeking to minimize downtime and enhance BC (Business Continuity) and DR (Disaster Recovery) capabilities will create agreements with other, similar organizations. They agree that if one of the parties experiences an emergency and cannot operate within their own facility, the other party will share its resources and let them operate within theirs in order to maintain critical functions. These agreements often even include competitors, because their facilities and resources meet the needs of their particular industry. 

### For example, Hospital A and Hospital B are competitors in the same city. The hospitals create an agreement with each other: if something bad happens to Hospital A (a fire, flood, bomb threat, loss of power, etc.), that hospital can temporarily send personnel and systems to work inside Hospital B in order to stay in business during the interruption (and Hospital B can relocate to Hospital A, if Hospital B has a similar problem). The hospitals have decided that they are not going to compete based on safety and securityâ€”they are going to compete on service, price and customer loyalty. This way, they protect themselves and the healthcare industry as a whole.  

### These agreements are called joint operating agreements (JOA) or memoranda of understanding (MOU) or memoranda of agreement (MOA). Sometimes these agreements are mandated by regulatory requirements, or they might just be part of the administrative safeguards instituted by an entity within the guidelines of its industry. 

### The difference between an MOA or MOU  and an SLA is that a Memorandum of Understanding is more directly related to what can be done with a system or the information. 

### The service level agreement goes down to the granular level. For example, if I'm outsourcing the IT services, then I will need to have two full-time technicians readily available, at least from Monday through Friday from eight to five. With cloud computing, I need to have access to the information in my backup systems within 10 minutes. An SLA specifies the more intricate aspects of the services.  

### We must be very cautious when outsourcing with cloud-based services, because we have to make sure that we understand exactly what we are agreeing to. If the SLA promises 100 percent accessibility to information, is the access directly to you at the moment, or is it access to their website or through their portal when they open on Monday? That's where you'll rely on your legal team, who can supervise and review the conditions carefully before you sign the dotted line at the bottom.
