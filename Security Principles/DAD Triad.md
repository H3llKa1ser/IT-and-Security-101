# DAD Triad

## Essentially, the exact opposite of CIA Triad

### In information security, the DAD triad typically stands for "Disclosure, Alteration, and Destruction." It refers to the three primary categories of security threats or risks that information assets may face. Here's a breakdown of each component:

## 1) Disclosure:

 - Disclosure refers to the unauthorized exposure or release of sensitive or confidential information. This could include personal data, intellectual property, financial records, or any other type of sensitive information. Disclosure threats can arise from various sources, such as hacking attacks, data breaches, insider threats, or unintentional disclosure due to poor security practices.

## 2) Alteration:

 - Alteration involves unauthorized changes or modifications to information or data. This could include unauthorized access to and manipulation of data, tampering with system configurations or settings, or injecting malicious code into software or databases. Alteration threats can lead to the integrity of information being compromised, resulting in inaccurate or unreliable data that can adversely affect business operations or decision-making processes.

## 3) Destruction:

 - Destruction refers to the unauthorized deletion, removal, or destruction of information or data. This could involve malicious actions such as deleting critical files or databases, corrupting data to make it unusable, or launching denial-of-service (DoS) attacks to disrupt access to systems or services. Destruction threats can result in data loss, service downtime, financial losses, and reputational damage to organizations.

### The DAD triad provides a framework for understanding and categorizing the potential risks to information security and helps organizations prioritize their security efforts and implement appropriate controls to mitigate these risks. By addressing threats related to disclosure, alteration, and destruction, organizations can better protect their information assets and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their data.
