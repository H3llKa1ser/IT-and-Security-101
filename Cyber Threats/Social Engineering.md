### Methods which an attacker can use to trick a victim into doing things or giving information

### Social Engineering Attacks

#### 1) Baiting: Attracting victims by dangling something in front of them

#### 2) Vishing: Uses an IVR system trick victims into giving passwords

#### 3) Pretexting: Someone impersonates an authority figure

#### 4) Quid Pro Quo: A request for information in exchange for compensation

#### 5) Tailgating: Someone follows you into a restricted area

#### 6) Phishing: Attackers impersonate legitimate entities (such as banks, government agencies, or trusted companies) via email, text message, or phone call to trick victims into providing sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or account details.

#### 7) Spear Fishing: Similar to phishing, but tailored to specific individuals or organizations. Attackers gather information about their targets to create personalized and convincing messages, increasing the likelihood of success.

#### 8) Impersonation: Attackers impersonate someone else, such as a colleague, contractor, or authority figure, to gain trust and access to sensitive information or systems.

#### 9) Smishing (SMS Phishing): Attackers use SMS (text messages) to send fraudulent messages containing links or requests for personal information, tricking recipients into taking actions that compromise security.

#### 10) Watering Hole Attack: Attackers compromise websites frequented by their targets and inject malicious code to infect visitors' devices with malware or exploit vulnerabilities.

#### 11) Reverse social engineering: Attackers manipulate victims into reaching out for help, assistance, or support, then exploit their trust to gather sensitive information or gain unauthorized access.

#### 12) Shoulder Surfing: Attackers observe or eavesdrop on individuals as they enter sensitive information, such as passwords or PINs, in public places or over their shoulders.

### Each of these social engineering attacks relies on exploiting human psychology, trust, or curiosity to bypass technical security measures and gain unauthorized access to information or systems. It's essential for individuals and organizations to stay vigilant, educate themselves about these tactics, and implement security awareness training and protocols to mitigate the risks associated with social engineering attacks.
