# Data handling techniques

## Data Scrubbing

### Using security controls when copying production data for use in testing. This is accomplished by overwriting sensitive data values with meaningless ones.

## Data deduplication

### The process that scans the entire collection of information looking for similar chunks of data that can be consolidated

## Information Rights Management (IRM)

### Assign specific properties to an object such as how long the object may exist, and who/what may access it

## Managing Encryption Keys

### Considerations include:

#### 1) Roles and Responsibilities

#### 2) Key Generation and Storage

#### 3) Distribution

#### 4) Expiration

#### 5) Revocation and Destruction

#### 6) Audit and Tracking

#### 7) Emergence Management
