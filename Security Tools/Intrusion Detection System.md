# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

### IDS is a tool in a layered security model

#### 1) Identify suspicious activity

#### 2) Log activity

#### 3) Respond (alert people)

#### 4) Needs an interface in promiscuous mode

#### Can capture all traffic regardless of the destination address

#### 5) Sniffer + Analysis Engine = IDS

#### 6) Port Mirroring/Spanb needs to be enabled to view traffic on a switch

## IDS Categories

### 1) HIDS: Host-based Intrusion Detection System

### 2) NIDS: Network Intrusion Detection System

## IDS Components

### Both type of IDS have several components that make up the product:

### 1) Sensor - Data collector:

#### 1) On network segments (NIDS)

#### 2) On host (HIDS)

### 2) Analysis Engine (AE): Analyzes data collected by the sensor, determines if there is suspicious activity

### 3) Signature database: Used by the AE, defines signatures of previously known attacks

### 4) User interface and reporting: The way the system interacts with users

## More IDS Tools:

### 1) Balanced Magnetic Switch (BMS): Uses a magnetic field or mechanical contact to determine if an alarm signal is initiated

### 2) Motion activated cameras: A fixed camera with a video motion feature that signals an alarm when something enters the field of view

### 3) Acoustic Sensors: A device that uses passive listening devices to monitor building spaces (Designed to detect stay-behind intruders)

### 4) Infrared Linear Beam Sensors: A focused infrared light beam is projected and bounced off a reflector on the other side of the detection area

### 5) Passive Infrared (PIR) Sensors: Picks up heat signatures to detect intruders (PIRs are also used as an automatic request exit (REX) device

### 6) Dual-Technology Sensors: Using two different kinds of sensors to reduce false alarms

### 7) Visitor control: Consideration factors include:

#### Controlled waiting room

#### Temporary badges or passes

#### Being escorted around the organization
