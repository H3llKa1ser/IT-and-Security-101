# Cloud Computing Definition

### Cloud computing is usually associated with an internet-based set of computing resources, and typically sold as a service, provided by a cloud service provider (CSP). 

### Cloud computing is very similar to the electrical or power grid. It is provisioned in a geographic location and is sourced using an electrical means that is not necessarily obvious to the consumer. But when you want electricity, it’s available to you via a common standard interface and you pay only for what you use. In these ways, cloud computing is very similar. It is a very scalable, elastic and easy-to-use “utility” for the provisioning and deployment of Information Technology (IT) services.  

### There are various definitions of what cloud computing means according to the leading standards, including NIST. This NIST definition is commonly used around the globe, cited by professionals and others alike to clarify what the term “cloud” means:  

#### “a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (such as networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.” NIST SP 800-145
