# Identification

### Identity proofing takes place before an individual is hired and is usually conducted by the HR department

### Once hired, the user account is provisioned and rights/permissions are assigned

### Once an account has been provisioned, the first step a user undertakes to access a system is to provide identification

### Identification MUST be unique for accountability

### Standard naming schemes should be used

### Identifier should not indicate extra info about user (Job position)

### Unless authentication is used, identities are easily spoofed
