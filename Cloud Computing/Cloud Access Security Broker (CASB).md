# Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)

### A Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) is a software tool or service that acts as an intermediary between users and cloud service providers, providing security, compliance, and governance features for cloud applications. CASBs are designed to give organizations visibility into and control over their use of cloud services.

### Here are some key functions and features typically provided by CASBs:

1. **Visibility**: CASBs provide visibility into the cloud applications being used within an organization, including shadow IT (unsanctioned cloud services).

2. **Data Security**: They enforce security policies to protect data stored in cloud applications, such as encryption, tokenization, and data loss prevention (DLP) techniques.

3. **Access Control**: CASBs manage and enforce access control policies to ensure that only authorized users and devices can access cloud applications.

4. **Compliance Monitoring**: They help organizations ensure compliance with industry regulations and standards by monitoring activities within cloud applications and enforcing policies accordingly.

5. **Threat Protection**: CASBs offer threat detection and prevention capabilities, including malware detection, anomaly detection, and user behavior analytics.

6. **Identity and Authentication**: They provide identity and access management (IAM) capabilities, including single sign-on (SSO) and multi-factor authentication (MFA), to securely authenticate users accessing cloud applications.

### Overall, CASBs play a crucial role in enabling organizations to securely adopt and manage cloud services, addressing concerns related to data security, compliance, and governance in the cloud.
