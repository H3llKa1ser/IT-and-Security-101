# Assess compliance against security frameworks and Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Microsoft Defender for Cloud helps streamline the process for meeting regulatory compliance requirements, using the regulatory compliance dashboard. Defender for Cloud continuously assesses your hybrid cloud environment to analyze the risk factors according to the controls and best practices in the standards that you've applied to your subscriptions. The dashboard reflects the status of your compliance with these standards.

When you enable Defender for Cloud on an Azure subscription, the Microsoft cloud security benchmark is automatically assigned to that subscription. This widely respected benchmark builds on the controls from the Center for Internet Security (CIS), Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards (DSS) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with a focus on cloud-centric security.

The regulatory compliance dashboard shows the status of all the assessments within your environment for your chosen standards and regulations. As you act on the recommendations and reduce risk factors in your environment, your compliance posture improves.

#### NOTE: Compliance data from Defender for Cloud now seamlessly integrates with Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager, allowing you to centrally assess and manage compliance across your organization's entire digital estate. When you add any standard to your compliance dashboard (including compliance standards monitoring other clouds like AWS and GCP), the resource-level compliance data is automatically surfaced in Compliance Manager for the same standard. Compliance Manager thus provides improvement actions and status across your cloud infrastructure and all other digital assets in this central tool.
