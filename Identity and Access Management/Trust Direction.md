# Trust Direction

### Trust: The belief in the security of a connection between domains

### Trusted Path: A series of trust relationships that authentication requests must follow between domains

### Kinds of trusts include:

#### 1) One-way Trust

#### 2) Two-way Trust (AKA Bidirectional Trust)

#### 3) Trust Transitivity

### Trust Transitivity determines whether a trust can be extended outside the two domains between which the trust was formed.

### Example:

## "DOMAIN A" ACCESS ->  "DOMAIN B" and "DOMAIN B" ACCESS -> "DOMAIN C" therefore "DOMAIN A" ACCESS -> "DOMAIN C"
