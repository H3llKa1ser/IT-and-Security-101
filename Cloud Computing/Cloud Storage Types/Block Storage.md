# Block Storage

### Block storage involves storing data in volumes or blocks, with each block being treated as an individual hard drive. These blocks can be accessed and managed independently.

### Protocols commonly used with block storage include:

 - iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface)

 - Fibre Channel (FC)

 - NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF)

### Block storage is often used for databases, virtual machine disks, and other performance-sensitive applications that require low-latency access to data.
