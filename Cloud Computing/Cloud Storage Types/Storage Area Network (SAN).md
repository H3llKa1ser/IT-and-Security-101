# Storage Area Network (SAN)

### SAN is a dedicated network that provides access to block-level storage devices. It allows multiple servers to access shared storage resources as if they were locally attached.

### SAN protocols include:

 -  Fibre Channel (FC)
 
 -  iSCSI
 
 -  Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE).

### SANs are commonly used in enterprise environments for high-performance storage and data center consolidation.
