### The intent of a business continuity plan is to sustain business operations while recovering from a significant disruption. An event has created a disturbance in the environment, and now you need to know how to maintain the business. 

### A key part of the plan is communication, including multiple contact methodologies and backup numbers in case of a disruption of power or communications. Many organizations will establish a phone tree, so that if one person is not available, they know who else to call. Organizations will go through their procedures and checklists to make sure they know exactly who is responsible for which action. No matter how many times they have flown, without fail, pilots go through a checklist before take-off. Similarly, there must be established procedures and a thorough checklist, so that no vital element of business continuity will be missed. 

### We call the appropriate individuals and start to activate the business continuity plan. Management must be included, because sometimes priorities may change depending on the situation. Individuals with proper authority must be there to execute operations, for instance, if there are critical areas that need to be shut down. 

### We need to have at hand the critical contact numbers for the supply chain, as well as law enforcement and other sites outside of the facility. For example, a hospital may suffer a severe cyberattack that affects communications from the pharmacy, the internet or phone lines. In the United States, in case of this type of cyberattack that knocks out communications, specific numbers in specific networks can bypass the normal cell phone services and use military-grade networks. Those will be assigned to authorized individuals for hospitals or other critical infrastructures in case of a major disruption or cyberattack, so they can still maintain essential activity.
