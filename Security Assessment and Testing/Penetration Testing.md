# Penetration Testing

### Active, potentially intrusive process of simulating attacks on a network

## 3 Basic requirements

#### 1) Meet with Senior Management to determine the goal of the assessment

#### 2) Document Rules of Engagement (RoE)

#### 3) Get sign off from Senior Management

### Penetration testing uses a set of procedures and tools designed to test and possibly bypass the security controls of a system

### Goal is to measure an organization's level of resistance to an attack and to uncover any weaknesses within the environment

### Emulates the same methods attackers would use

### Penetration testing should only be conducted with senior management's approval in writing

# Penetration Testing Steps

### 1) Discovery: Footprinting and gathering information about the target

### 2) Enumeration: Performing port scans and resource identification methods

### 3) Vulnerability mapping: Identifying vulnerabilities in identified systems and resources

### 4) Exploitation: Attempting to gain unauthorized access by exploiting vulnerabilities

### 5) Report to Management: Delivering to management documentation of test findings along with suggested countermeasures
