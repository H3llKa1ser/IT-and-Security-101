# Authorized vs Unauthorized

### Subjects are authorized access to objects after they have been authenticated. Remember from earlier sections that authentication is confirming the identity of the subject. Once a subject has been authenticated, the system checks its authorization to see if it is allowed to complete the action it is attempting. This is usually done via a security matrix accessed by the system controlling the access, based on pre-approved levels. For example, when a person presents an ID badge to the data center door, the system checks the ID number, compares that to a security matrix within the system, and unlocks the door if the ID is authorized. If the ID is not authorized to unlock the door, it will remain locked. In another example, a user attempts to delete a file. The file system checks the permissions to see if the user is authorized to delete the file. If the user is authorized, the file is deleted. If the user is not authorized, an error message is displayed, and the file is left untouched.
