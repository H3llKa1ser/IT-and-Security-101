### Today's Identity Management in the Cloud

#### 1) Provisioning Identities (SCIM*) *Simple Cloud Identity Management

#### 2) Authentication (SAML, OpenID)

#### 3) Authorization (Oauth)

### As a company on-boards and off-boards employees, they are added and removed from the company's electronic employee directory. 

### As long as the service provider supports the SCIM standard, SCIM could then be used to automatically add/delete those users in external systems such as Google Apps for Work, Office 365, or saleforce.com.

### Then, a new user account would exist in the external systems for each new employee, and the user accounts for former employees would be removed for those systems.
