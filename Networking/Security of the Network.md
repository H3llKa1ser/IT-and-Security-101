### TCP/IPâ€™s vulnerabilities are numerous. Improperly implemented TCP/IP stacks in various operating systems are vulnerable to various DoS/DDoS attacks, fragment attacks, oversized packet attacks, spoofing attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### TCP/IP (as well as most protocols) is also subject to passive attacks via monitoring or sniffing. Network monitoring, or sniffing, is the act of monitoring traffic patterns to obtain information about a network.
