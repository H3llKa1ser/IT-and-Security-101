# Managed Service Provider (MSP)

### A managed service provider (MSP) is a company that manages information technology assets for another company. Small- and medium-sized businesses commonly outsource part or all of their information technology functions to an MSP to manage day-to-day operations or to provide expertise in areas the company does not have. Organizations may also use an MSP to provide network and security monitoring and patching services. Today, many MSPs offer cloud-based services augmenting SaaS solutions with active incident investigation and response activities. One such example is a managed detection and response (MDR) service, where a vendor monitors firewall and other security tools to provide expertise in triaging events. 

### Some other common MSP implementations are: 

#### 1) Augment in-house staff for projects

#### 2) Utilize expertise for implementation of a product or service

#### 3) Provide payroll services

#### 4) Provide Help Desk service management

#### 5) Monitor and respond to security incidents

#### 6) Manage all in-house IT infrastructure
