# Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)

### Cisco designed Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F) to break free of dependence on IP networks, but kept it proprietary

### L2TP was a combination of L2F and PPTP 

### Designed to be implemented in software solutions

### THERE IS NO SECURITY WITH L2TP! IT MUST USE IPSEC TO SECURE!
