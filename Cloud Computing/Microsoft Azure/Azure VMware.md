# Azure VMware

What if youâ€™re already established with VMware in a private cloud environment but want to migrate to a public or hybrid cloud? Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.

Azure VMware Solution is an Azure service that delivers a vSphere-based, single-tenant, private cloud. It's deployed on dedicated bare-metal infrastructure in Azure.

You can now seamlessly run, manage, and secure applications across VMware environments and Microsoft Azure with a common operating framework.

## Example case

Imagine you work for a healthcare company that runs many of its production workloads on a VMware vSphere platform. IT operations are spread over many offices.

A few trends surfaced in recent months. Some locations have equipment nearing end of life, so hardware refresh decisions need to be made soon. Also, your company can't procure new infrastructure quickly enough to meet requests for hardware refreshes and new applications. The requisition process, approvals, and logistics can take four to six months, if not longer.

One avenue that your company is interested in exploring involves migrating VMware vSphere workloads to the cloud without changing virtualization platforms or altering existing operational patterns.
