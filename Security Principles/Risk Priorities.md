# Risk Priorities

### When risks have been identified, it is time to prioritize and analyze core risks through qualitative risk analysis and/or quantitative risk analysis. This is necessary to determine root cause and narrow down apparent risks and core risks. Security professionals work with their teams to conduct both qualitative and quantitative analysis. 

### Understanding the organization’s overall mission and the functions that support the mission helps to place risks in context, determine the root causes and prioritize the assessment and analysis of these items. In most cases, management will provide direction for using the findings of the risk assessment to determine a prioritized set of risk-response actions.

### One effective method to prioritize risk is to use a risk matrix, which helps identify priority as the intersection of likelihood of occurrence and impact. It also gives the team a common language to use with management when determining the final priorities. For example, a low likelihood and a low impact might result in a low priority, while an incident with a high likelihood and high impact will result in a high priority. Assignment of priority may relate to business priorities, the cost of mitigating a risk or the potential for loss if an incident occurs.
