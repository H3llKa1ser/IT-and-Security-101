# Web Application Assessments

### Web Vulnerability scanning tools provide focused testing for web applications

#### 1) Scan all applications when you begin performing web vulnerability scanning for the first time. This will detect issues with legacy applications

#### 2) Scan any new application before moving it into a production environment for the first time

#### 3) Scan any modified application before the code changes move into production

#### 4) Scan all applications on a reccuring basis

#### 5) Fuzzing is the term for testing applications for lack of input validation and/or other known flaws
