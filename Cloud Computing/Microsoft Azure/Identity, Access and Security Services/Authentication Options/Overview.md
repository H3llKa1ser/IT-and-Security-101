# Authentication Options

Choosing the correct authentication method is the first concern for organizations wanting to move their apps to the cloud. Don't take this decision lightly, for the following reasons:

1) It's the first decision for an organization that wants to move to the cloud.

2) The authentication method is a critical component of an organization's presence in the cloud. It controls access to all cloud data and resources.

3) It's the foundation of all the other advanced security and user experience features in Microsoft Entra ID.

Identity is the new control plane of IT security, so authentication is an organization's access guard to the new cloud world. Organizations need an identity control plane that strengthens their security and keeps their cloud apps safe from intruders.

## Out of Scope

Organizations that don't have an existing on-premises directory footprint aren't the focus of this article. Typically, those businesses create identities only in the cloud, which doesn't require a hybrid identity solution. Cloud-only identities exist solely in the cloud and aren't associated with corresponding on-premises identities.

## Authentication Methods

When the Microsoft Entra hybrid identity solution is your new control plane, authentication is the foundation of cloud access. Choosing the correct authentication method is a crucial first decision in setting up a Microsoft Entra hybrid identity solution. The authentication method you choose, is configured by using Microsoft Entra Connect, which also provisions users in the cloud.

To choose an authentication method, you need to consider the time, existing infrastructure, complexity, and cost of implementing your choice. These factors are different for every organization and might change over time.
