# Defense-In-Depth

The objective of defense-in-depth is to protect information and prevent it from being stolen by those who aren't authorized to access it.

A defense-in-depth strategy uses a series of mechanisms to slow the advance of an attack that aims at acquiring unauthorized access to data.

## You can visualize defense-in-depth as a set of layers, with the data to be secured at the center and all the other layers functioning to protect that central data layer.
