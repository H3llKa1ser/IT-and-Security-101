# Padded Cell and Vulnerability Tools

### Concept used in software programming where a "safe" environment is created for applications and processes to run in (Similar to a VM)

### Concept used in IDS where identified intruder is moved to a "safe" environment without their knowing

### Simulated environment to keep the intruder happy and busy (Hopefully leave production systems alone)

### AKA: Self mutating Honeypot, Tarpit
