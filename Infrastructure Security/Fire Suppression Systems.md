# Fire Suppression Systems

### 1) Wet systems: Constant supply of water. Will not shut off until water source is shut off.

### 2) Dry systems: Do not have water in them. The valve will not release until it is stimulated by excess heat.

### 3) Pre-Action systems: Incorporates a detection system. Water is held back until the detectors are activated.

### 4) Deluge systems: Operates the same as the Pre-Action system except the sprinkler heads are in the open position.

### Water solutions are good for large physical areas but not for computer equipment.

### For computer equipment, use gas fire suppression systems:

#### 1) Aero-K: An aerosol of microscopic potassium compounds and uses multiple fire detectors

#### 2) FM-200: A colorless, liquified compressed gas
