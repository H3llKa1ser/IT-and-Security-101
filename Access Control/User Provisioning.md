# User provisioning

### Other situations that call for provisioning new user accounts or changing privileges include: 

#### 1) A new employee—When a new employee is hired, the hiring manager sends a request to the security administrator to create a new user ID. This request authorizes creation of the new ID and provides instructions on appropriate access levels. Additional authorization may be required by company policy for elevated permissions. 

#### 2) Change of position—When an employee has been promoted, their permissions and access rights might change as defined by the new role, which will dictate any added privileges and updates to access. At the same time, any access that is no longer needed in the new job will be removed. 

#### 3) Separation of employment—When employees leave the company, depending on company policy and procedures, their accounts must be disabled after the termination date and time. It is recommended that accounts be disabled for a period before they are deleted to preserve the integrity of any audit trails or files that may be owned by the user. Since the account will no longer be used, it should be removed from any security roles or additional access profiles. This protects the company, so the separated employee is unable to access company data after separation, and it also protects them because their account cannot be used by others to access data.

## NOTE: Upon hiring or changing roles, a best practice is to not copy user profiles to new users, because this promotes “permission or privilege creep.” For example, if an employee is given additional access to complete a task and that access is not removed when the task is completed, and then that user’s profile is copied to create a new user ID, the new ID is created with more permissions than are needed to complete their functions. It is recommended that standard roles are established, and new users are created based on those standards rather than an actual user.
