# Regulatory Compliance

Regulatory compliance refers to the discipline and process of ensuring that a company follows the laws enforced by governing bodies in their geography or rules required by voluntarily adopted industry standards. For IT regulatory compliance, people and processes monitor corporate systems to detect and prevent violations of policies and procedures established by these governing laws, regulations, and standards. This in turn applies to a wide array of monitoring and enforcement processes. Depending on the industry and geography, these processes can become lengthy and complex.

Compliance is challenging for multinational organizations, especially in heavily regulated industries like healthcare and financial services. Standards and regulations abound, and in certain cases may change frequently, making it difficult for businesses to keep up with changing international electronic data handling laws.

As with security controls, organizations should understand the division of responsibilities regarding regulatory compliance in the cloud. Cloud providers strive to ensure that their platforms and services are compliant. Organizations also need to confirm that their applications, the infrastructure those applications depend on, and services supplied by third parties are also certified as compliant.

The Cloud Adoption Framework governance model identifies key areas of importance during the journey. Each area relates to different types of risks the company must address as it adopts cloud services. Within this framework, the governance guide identifies required actions for the cloud governance team. Along the way, each principle of the Cloud Adoption Framework governance model is described further.

### Corporate policies

Corporate policies drive cloud governance. The governance guide focuses on specific aspects of corporate policy:

1) Business risks: Identifying and understanding corporate risks.

2) Policy and compliance: Converting risks into policy statements that support any compliance requirements.

3) Processes: Ensuring adherence to the stated policies.

Five Disciplines of Cloud Governance: These disciplines support the corporate policies. Each discipline protects the company from potential pitfalls:

1) Cost Management discipline

2) Security Baseline discipline

3) Resource Consistency discipline

4) Identity Baseline discipline

5) Deployment Acceleration discipline

Essentially, corporate policies serve as an early warning system to detect potential problems. The disciplines help the company manage risks and create guardrails.
