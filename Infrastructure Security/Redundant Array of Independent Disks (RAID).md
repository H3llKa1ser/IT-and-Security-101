# Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)

### RAID - 0: Disk Striping = Provides no redundancy or fault tolerance but provides performance improvements for read/write functions

### RAID - 1: Disk Mirroring = Provides redundancy but is often considered to be least efficient usage of space

### RAID - 2: Disk striping is performed at the bit level. Redundant but too power consuming. (NOT USED IN PRACTICE)

### RAID - 3: Disk striping is performed at the byte level and uses a dedicated parity disk. Redundant but too power consuming. (NOT USED IN PRACTICE)

### RAID - 4: Disk striping at the block level and use a dedicated parity disk. (NOT USED IN PRACTICE)

### RAID - 5: Disk striping with Parity = Fault Tolerance + Speed

## Mirroring: The system writes data simultaneously to separate hard drives or drive arrays

## Parity: The technique of determining whether data had been lost or overwritten

## Striping: A data element is broken into multiple pieces, and a piece is distributed to each hard drive
