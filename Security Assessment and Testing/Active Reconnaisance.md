# Active Reconnaisance

### Active reconnaissance, also known as active information gathering or active footprinting, is a technique used in cybersecurity and penetration testing to gather information about a target system, network, or organization by directly interacting with it. Unlike passive reconnaissance, which relies on publicly available information and data sources, active reconnaissance involves sending requests, probes, or queries to target systems to gather intelligence. Here are some common methods of active reconnaissance:

1. **Port Scanning**:
   - Port scanning involves sending requests to target systems to identify open ports and services running on those ports. By scanning for open ports, an attacker or penetration tester can determine what services are available and potentially vulnerable to exploitation.

2. **Service Enumeration**:
   - Service enumeration involves querying identified ports to gather additional information about the services running on the target system. This can include retrieving banner information, version numbers, and other details that may help identify vulnerabilities or weaknesses.

3. **Network Mapping**:
   - Network mapping involves probing target networks to identify network devices, topology, and relationships between systems. This can help attackers or penetration testers understand the structure of the target environment and identify potential points of entry.

4. **Active Vulnerability Scanning**:
   - Active vulnerability scanning involves using automated tools to scan target systems for known vulnerabilities or weaknesses. This can include identifying outdated software versions, misconfigured services, or insecure protocols that may be exploited by attackers.

5. **Brute Force Attacks**:
   - Brute force attacks involve systematically trying every possible combination of usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access to target systems. This technique can be used to identify weak or default credentials that may provide access to sensitive information or resources.

6. **Traffic Analysis**:
   - Traffic analysis involves monitoring and analyzing network traffic generated by target systems to identify patterns, trends, and potential security risks. This can include analyzing network protocols, communication patterns, and anomalies that may indicate suspicious or malicious activity.

### Active reconnaissance is a critical component of the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test or security assessment. By actively interacting with target systems, attackers and penetration testers can gather detailed information about vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential points of entry. However, it's important to conduct active reconnaissance ethically and with permission from the target organization to avoid unauthorized access or disruption of services.
