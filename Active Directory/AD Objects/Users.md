# Users (AD)

### They are one of the objects known as Security Principals, meaning that they can be authenticated by the domain and can be assigned privileges over resources like files or printers.

### Users represent 2 types of entities:

## 1) People

 - Users will generally represent persons, like employees.

## 2) Services

 - Users can also be defined as services like IIS (Internet Information Services), MSSQL, etc.

### Every single service requires a user to run, but service users are different from regular users as they will only have the privileges needed to run their specific service.
