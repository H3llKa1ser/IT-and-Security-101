# Virtualization

### The foundation for a scalable cloud and the first step for building cloud infrastructure

### Hypervisor: A piece of software, hardware or firmware that runs virtual machines

#### 1) Type 1: Native or Bare-Metal

#### 2) Type 2: Hosted

# Types of Virtualization

### Server Virtualization: Multiple Operating Systems can run on one server

### Network Virtualization: Reproduction of a physical network in software

### Desktop Virtualization: Deploying desktops

### Application Virtualization: Applications as a managed service

### Storage Virtualization: Abstracts disks and flash drives

## Definition

### At its most basic level, virtualization is the concept of encapsulating the capabilities and features of a physical machine in a virtual environment, known as a virtual machine.

### But why is virtualization needed? For most organizations and individuals, virtualization comes from a need of the following:

#### 1) Decrease expenses:

 - Physical servers can be expensive, and virtualization can decrease the number of servers or other hardware, or even completely remove physical hardware from a company's infrastructure.

#### 2) Scale:

 -  Without properly implemented DevOps, it may be hard for a company to scale resources as server usage increases. Virtualization makes this process easier and can delegate a server's resources to virtual machines as needed based on usage.

#### 3) Efficiency:

 -  Like scaling, virtualization can also make it easier to decrease the resources allocated to a virtual machine if there is reduced usage.

# Virtualization Structure

### Virtualization is implemented using an engine-machine format, which means that a software or system creates an abstraction layer and allocates resources, while an operating system or application can then be installed on top of this virtualized environment. The operating system installed in a virtual machine is known as a guest OS, as opposed to the host OS on which the virtualization engine is running.
