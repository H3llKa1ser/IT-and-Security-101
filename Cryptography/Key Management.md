# Key Management

### The most important part of any cryptographic implementation

### "A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key is public knowledge" - Auguste Kerckhoff

# Key Management Applications

### 1) XML Key Management specification 2.0: Protocols for distributingand registering public keys.

### 2) ANSI X9.17: Developed to address the need of financial institutions. Uses Data Keys (DKs) and Key-encrypting Keys (KKMs).

# Key Distribution and Management

### Secure keys depend on Automatic Key Generation, Randomness and Length

#### 1) Automatic Key Generation: Key Enforcement Policy

#### 2) Randomness: The randomness of zeroes and ones

#### 3) Key Length: The longer the key, the more difficult it is
