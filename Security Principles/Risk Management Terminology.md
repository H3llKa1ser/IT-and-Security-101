# Risk Management Terminology

### Asset: Something in need of protection

### Vulnerability: A gap or weakness in those protection efforts

### Threat: Something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to thwart protection efforts

### Risk: The intersection of these 3 terms

### Likelihood/Probability: Likelihood of occurence is a weighted factor based on a subjective analysis of the probability that a given threat or set of threats is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability or set of vulnerabilities.

# Risk formula:

## RISK = ASSET * THREAT * VULNERABILITY
