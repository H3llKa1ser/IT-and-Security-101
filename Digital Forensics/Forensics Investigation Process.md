## 1) Identification:

### Locard's Principle of Exchange: When a crime is committed, the attacker takes something and leaves something behind. What they leave behind can help us identify aspects of the responsible party.

## 2) Preservation:

### Chain of Custody must be well documented

### A history of how evidence was 

#### 1) Collected

#### 2) Analyzed

#### 3) Transported

#### 4) Preserved

### Necessary because digital evidence can be manipulated so easily

### Hashing algorithms are used to show the integrity of the evidence has not been modified by the investigation process.

## 3) Collection

###  1) Minimize handling/corruption of evidence

### 2) Keep detailed logs of your actions

### 3) Do not exceed your knowledge

### 4) Follow organization's security policy

### 5) Capture an accurate image of the system

### 6) Ensure actions are repeatable

### 7) Work Fast ( digital evidence may have a short lifespan)

### 8) Work from volatile to persistent evidence

### 9) DO NOT run any programs or open any files on the infected system until a forensic copy of the disk has been made!!!

## 4) Examination

### Look for signatures of known attacks

### Review audit logs

### Hidden data recovery

## 5) Analysis

### Primary Image (original) VS Working Image (copy)

### Working Image should be bit by bit copy of the original

### Both copies must be hashed and the working copy should be write-protected

### What is the root cause?

### What files were altereed/installed?

### What communications channels were opened?

## 6) Presentation

### Interpreting the results of the investigation and presenting the findings in an appropriate format

### Documentation

### Expert Testimony

## 7) Decision

### What is the result of the investigation?

### Suspects?

### Corrective Actions?
