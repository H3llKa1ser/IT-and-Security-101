# Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR)

Microsoft best practices for ransomware protection are based on a three step approach:

1) Prepare your recovery plan

2) Limit the scope of the damage

3) Make it hard to get in

## Phase 1. Prepare your recovery plan

This phase is designed to minimize the monetary incentive from ransomware attackers by making it:

 - Harder to access and disrupt systems or encrypt or damage key organization data.

 - Easier for your organization to recover from an attack without paying the ransom.

#### NOTE: While restoring many or all enterprise systems is a difficult endeavor, the alternative of paying an attacker for a recovery key they may or may not deliver, and using tools written by the attackers to try to recover systems and data.

## Phase 2. Limit the scope of damage

Make the attackers work a lot harder to gain access to multiple business critical systems through privileged access roles. Limiting the attacker’s ability to get privileged access makes it much harder to profit off of an attack on your organization, making it more likely they'll give up and go elsewhere.

## Phase 3. Make it hard to get in

This last set of tasks is important to raise friction for entry but will take time to complete as part of a larger security journey. The goal of this phase is to make the attackers' work much harder as they try to obtain access to your on-premises or cloud infrastructures at the various common points of entry. There are many tasks, so it’s important to prioritize your work here based on how fast you can accomplish them with your current resources.

While many of these will be familiar and easy to quickly accomplish, it’s critically important that your work on phase 3 should not slow down your progress on phases 1 and 2!

# Backup and Restore plan with Azure Backup

Azure Backup provides security to your backup environment, both when your data is in transit and at rest. With Azure Backup, you can back up:

1) On-premises files, folders, and system state

2) Entire Windows/Linux VMs

3) Azure Managed Disks

4) Azure file shares to a storage account

5) SQL Server databases running on Azure VMs

The backup data is stored in Azure storage and the guest or attacker has no direct access to backup storage or its contents. With virtual machine backup, the backup snapshot creation and storage is done by Azure fabric where the guest or attacker has no involvement other than quiescing the workload for application consistent backups. With SQL and SAP HANA, the backup extension gets temporary access to write to specific blobs. In this way, even in a compromised environment, existing backups can't be tampered with or deleted by the attacker.

Azure Backup provides built-in monitoring and alerting capabilities to view and configure actions for events related to Azure Backup. Backup Reports serve as a one-stop destination for tracking usage, auditing of backups and restores, and identifying key trends at different levels of granularity. Using Azure Backup's monitoring and reporting tools can alert you to any unauthorized, suspicious, or malicious activity as soon as they occur.

Checks have been added to make sure only valid users can perform various operations. These include adding an extra layer of authentication. As part of adding an extra layer of authentication for critical operations, you're prompted to enter a security PIN before modifying online backups.

### What to do before an attack

As mentioned earlier, you should assume that at some point in time you'll fall victim to a ransomware attack. Identifying your business-critical systems and applying best practices before an attack will get you back up and running as quickly as possible.

### What to do during an attack

If you're attacked, your prioritized backup list becomes your prioritized restore list. Before you restore, validate again that your backup is good. You may be able to look for malware inside the backup.

### Post attack or simulation

After a ransomware attack or an incident response simulation, take the following steps to improve your backup and restore plans as well as your security posture:

1) Identify lessons learned where the process didn't work well (and opportunities to simplify, accelerate, or otherwise improve the process)

2) Perform root cause analysis on the biggest challenges. Ensure there is enough detail for solutions to address the right problems considering people, process, and technology.

3) Investigate and remediate the original breach (engage the Microsoft Detection and Response Team (DART) to help)

4) Update your backup and restore strategy based on lessons learned and opportunities. Prioritize based on highest impact and quickest implementation steps first.
