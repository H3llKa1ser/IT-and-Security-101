## 2) Scope of Work:

 - The scope of work defines the specific systems, networks, applications, or environments that will be included in the penetration testing engagement. It outlines the boundaries of the testing and specifies what will and will not be tested.

## 3) Objectives and Goals:

 - This section outlines the goals and objectives of the penetration testing engagement. It may include specific security objectives such as identifying vulnerabilities, assessing security controls, or testing incident response procedures.

## 4) Methodology:

 - The methodology section describes the approach and techniques that will be used during the penetration testing engagement. It may reference industry-standard methodologies such as the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) or the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) testing guides.
## 5) Deliverables:

 - Deliverables are the tangible outputs or results that the penetration testing team will provide to the client upon completion of the engagement. This may include a detailed report of findings, recommendations for remediation, executive summaries, and any other documentation or artifacts.
