# Azure Arc

Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment. Azure Arc can help manage your cloud environment, whether it's a public cloud solely on Azure, a private cloud in your datacenter, a hybrid configuration, or even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once.

Managing hybrid and multi-cloud environments can rapidly get complicated. Azure provides a host of tools to provision, configure, and monitor Azure resources. What about the on-premises resources in a hybrid configuration or the cloud resources in a multi-cloud configuration?

In utilizing Azure Resource Manager (ARM), Arc lets you extend your Azure compliance and monitoring to your hybrid and multi-cloud configurations. Azure Arc simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises management platform.

Azure Arc provides a centralized, unified way to:

1) Manage your entire environment together by projecting your existing non-Azure resources into ARM.

2) Manage multi-cloud and hybrid virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and databases as if they are running in Azure.

3) Use familiar Azure services and management capabilities, regardless of where they live.

4) Continue using traditional ITOps while introducing DevOps practices to support new cloud and native patterns in your environment.

5) Configure custom locations as an abstraction layer on top of Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters and cluster extensions.

## What can Azure Arc do outside of Azure?

Currently, Azure Arc allows you to manage the following resource types hosted outside of Azure:

1) Servers

2) Kubernetes clusters

3) Azure data services

4) SQL Server

5) Virtual machines (preview)
