# Physical Access Controls

### Physical access controls are items you can physically touch. They include physical mechanisms deployed to prevent, monitor, or detect direct contact with systems or areas within a facility. Examples of physical access controls include security guards, fences, motion detectors, locked doors/gates, sealed windows, lights, cable protection, laptop locks, badges, swipe cards, guard dogs, cameras, mantraps/turnstiles, and alarms.

### Physical access controls are necessary to protect the assets of a company, including its most important asset, people. When considering physical access controls, the security of the personnel always comes first, followed by securing other physical assets.

### Physical access controls include fences, barriers, turnstiles, locks and other features that prevent unauthorized individuals from entering a physical site, such as a workplace. This is to protect not only physical assets such as computers from being stolen, but also to protect the health and safety of the personnel inside. 

## Types of Physical Access Controls

### Many types of physical access control mechanisms can be deployed in an environment to control, monitor and manage access to a facility. These range from deterrents to detection mechanisms. Each area requires unique and focused physical access controls, monitoring and prevention mechanisms. The following sections discuss many such mechanisms that may be used to control access to various areas of a site, including perimeter and internal security.

#### 1) Badge Systems and Gate Entry

### Physical security controls for human traffic are often done with technologies such as turnstiles, mantraps and remotely or system-controlled door locks. For the system to identify an authorized employee, an access control system needs to have some form of enrollment station used to assign and activate an access control device. Most often, a badge is produced and issued with the employee’s identifiers, with the enrollment station giving the employee specific areas that will be accessible. In high-security environments, enrollment may also include biometric characteristics. In general, an access control system compares an individual’s badge against a verified database. If authenticated, the access control system sends output signals allowing authorized personnel to pass through a gate or a door to a controlled area. The systems are typically integrated with the organization’s logging systems to document access activity (authorized and unauthorized)

### A range of card types allow the system to be used in a variety of environments. These cards include:

##### 1) Bar code

##### 2) Magnetic Stripe

##### 3) Proximity

##### 4) Smart

##### 5) Hybrid

#### 2) Environmental Design

### Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) approaches the challenge of creating safer workspaces through passive design elements. This has great applicability for the information security community as security professionals design, operate and assess the organizational security environment. Other practices, such as standards for building construction and data centers, also affect how we implement controls over our physical environment. Security professionals should be familiar with these concepts so they can successfully advocate for functional and effective physical spaces where information is going to be created, processed and stored.

### CPTED provides direction to solve the challenges of crime with organizational (people), mechanical (technology and hardware) and natural design (architectural and circulation flow) methods. By directing the flow of people, using passive techniques to signal who should and should not be in a space and providing visibility to otherwise hidden spaces, the likelihood that someone will commit a crime in that area decreases.

#### 3) Biometrics

### To authenticate a user’s identity, biometrics uses characteristics unique to the individual seeking access. A biometric authentication solution entails two processes.

##### 1) Enrollment—during the enrollment process, the user’s registered biometric code is either stored in a system or on a smart card that is kept by the user.

##### 2) Verification—during the verification process, the user presents their biometric data to the system so that the biometric data can be compared with the stored biometric code.

### Even though the biometric data may not be secret, it is personally identifiable information, and the protocol should not reveal it without the user’s consent. Biometrics takes two primary forms, physiological and behavioral.

#### Physiological systems measure the characteristics of a person such as a fingerprint, iris scan (the colored portion around the outside of the pupil in the eye), retinal scan (the pattern of blood vessels in the back of the eye), palm scan and venous scans that look for the flow of blood through the veins in the palm. Some biometrics devices combine processes together—such as checking for pulse and temperature on a fingerprint scanner—to detect counterfeiting.

#### Behavioral systems measure how a person acts by measuring voiceprints, signature dynamics and keystroke dynamics. As a person types, a keystroke dynamics system measures behavior such as the delay rate (how long a person holds down a key) and transfer rate (how rapidly a person moves between keys).

### Biometric systems are considered highly accurate, but they can be expensive to implement and maintain because of the cost of purchasing equipment and registering all users. Users may also be uncomfortable with the use of biometrics, considering them to be an invasion of privacy or presenting a risk of disclosure of medical information (since retina scans can disclose medical conditions). A further drawback is the challenge of sanitization of the devices.


## Monitoring

### The use of physical access controls and monitoring personnel and equipment entering and leaving as well as auditing/logging all physical events are primary elements in maintaining overall organizational security. 

#### 1) Cameras: Cameras are normally integrated into the overall security program and centrally monitored. Cameras provide a flexible method of surveillance and monitoring. They can be a deterrent to criminal activity, can detect activities if combined with other sensors and, if recorded, can provide evidence after the activity They are often used in locations where access is difficult or there is a need for a forensic record.

#### While cameras provide one tool for monitoring the external perimeter of facilities, other technologies augment their detection capabilities. A variety of motion sensor technologies can be effective in exterior locations. These include infrared, microwave and lasers trained on tuned receivers. Other sensors can be integrated into doors, gates and turnstiles, and strain-sensitive cables and other vibration sensors can detect if someone attempts to scale a fence. Proper integration of exterior or perimeter sensors will alert an organization to any intruders attempting to gain access across open space or attempting to breach the fence line.

#### 2) Logs: In this section, we are concentrating on the use of physical logs, such as a sign-in sheet maintained by a security guard, or even a log created by an electronic system that manages physical access.

#### A log is a record of events that have occurred. Physical security logs are essential to support business requirements. They should capture and retain information as long as necessary for legal or business reasons. Because logs may be needed to prove compliance with regulations and assist in a forensic investigation, the logs must be protected from manipulation. Logs may also contain sensitive data about customers or users and should be protected from unauthorized disclosure.

#### The organization should have a policy to review logs regularly as part of their organization’s security program. As part of the organization’s log processes, guidelines for log retention must be established and followed. If the organizational policy states to retain standard log files for only six months, that is all the organization should have.

#### A log anomaly is anything out of the ordinary. Identifying log anomalies is often the first step in identifying security-related issues, both during an audit and during routine monitoring. Some anomalies will be glaringly obvious: for example, gaps in date/time stamps or account lockouts. Others will be harder to detect, such as someone trying to write data to a protected directory. Although it may seem that logging everything so you would not miss any important data is the best approach, most organizations would soon drown under the amount of data collected.

#### Business and legal requirements for log retention will vary among economies, countries and industries. Some businesses will have no requirements for data retention. Others are mandated by the nature of their business or by business partners to comply with certain retention data. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requires that businesses retain one year of log data in support of PCI. Some federal regulations include requirements for data retention as well.

#### If a business has no business or legal requirements to retain log data, how long should the organization keep it? The first people to ask should be the legal department. Most legal departments have very specific guidelines for data retention, and those guidelines may drive the log retention policy.

#### 3) Security Guards: Security guards are an effective physical security control. No matter what form of physical access control is used, a security guard or other monitoring system will discourage a person from masquerading as someone else or following closely on the heels of another to gain access. This helps prevent theft and abuse of equipment or information.

#### 4) Alarm Systems: Alarm systems are commonly found on doors and windows in homes and office buildings. In their simplest form, they are designed to alert the appropriate personnel when a door or window is opened unexpectedly.

#### For example, an employee may enter a code and/or swipe a badge to open a door, and that action would not trigger an alarm. Alternatively, if that same door was opened by brute force without someone entering the correct code or using an authorized badge, an alarm would be activated.

#### Another alarm system is a fire alarm, which may be activated by heat or smoke at a sensor and will likely sound an audible warning to protect human lives in the vicinity. It will likely also contact local response personnel as well as the closest fire department.

#### Finally, another common type of alarm system is in the form of a panic button. Once activated, a panic button will alert the appropriate police or security personnel.
