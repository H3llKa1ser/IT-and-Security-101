# Algorithms and keys

## Definition

## Algorithms

### Algorithms are the collection of math functions.

### Should be strong and complex math for substitution

### Should be open (Kerckoff's Principle)

## Keys

### Provide instructions on how to use the math

### Should be random 

### Should be protected

### Should be long "enough"

## Algorithm === Cipher

### Key length: The size of the key, measured in bits or bytes

#### 1) The security of an algorithm CANNOT EXCEED its key length

#### 2) The key's length is distinct from its cryptographic security

### Block Size: The size of the block used in block ciphers

#### 1) Blocks are fixed lengths, padding is sometimes necessary!

#### 2) Block size is directly related to security of the key!
