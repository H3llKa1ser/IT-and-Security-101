# Azure VMware

What if youâ€™re already established with VMware in a private cloud environment but want to migrate to a public or hybrid cloud? Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.

Azure VMware Solution is an Azure service that delivers a vSphere-based, single-tenant, private cloud. It's deployed on dedicated bare-metal infrastructure in Azure.

You can now seamlessly run, manage, and secure applications across VMware environments and Microsoft Azure with a common operating framework.

## Example case

Imagine you work for a healthcare company that runs many of its production workloads on a VMware vSphere platform. IT operations are spread over many offices.

A few trends surfaced in recent months. Some locations have equipment nearing end of life, so hardware refresh decisions need to be made soon. Also, your company can't procure new infrastructure quickly enough to meet requests for hardware refreshes and new applications. The requisition process, approvals, and logistics can take four to six months, if not longer.

One avenue that your company is interested in exploring involves migrating VMware vSphere workloads to the cloud without changing virtualization platforms or altering existing operational patterns.

Each company is in a different place in its digital transformation journey and use of the cloud. In partnership with VMware, Microsoft created Azure VMware Solution. It's a service that enables organizations to move VMware-based enterprise workloads from on-premises to Azure. Enabling them to deploy new virtual machines (VMs) and connect workloads directly to other Azure services.

Azure VMware Solution combines VMware's Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) software with the Azure global cloud service. It's a VMware-validated solution with ongoing certification and testing of enhancements and upgrades.

Microsoft manages Azure VMware Solution to meet performance, availability, security, and compliance requirements. Microsoft provides the following components to run Azure VMware Solution at scale in Azure:

 - Management systems

 - Networking services

 - Operating platform

 - Back-end infrastructure operations

The VMware vSphere clusters are built from bare-metal Azure hosts. These clusters are deployed and managed through the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or PowerShell. All provisioned private clouds have the standard supported versions of VMware vCenter Server, vSAN, vSphere, and NSX included and fully licensed. If you choose the service for your company, you can gain elasticity with the ability to add and remove capacity (compute, network, and storage resources) on demand.

## Key features

Azure VMware Solution provides a comprehensive VMware environment in Azure. It enables your organization to:

Use existing VMware solution investments: There's no need to reskill and learn new tools because the underlying products are the standard VMware vSphere and vCenter products. You can manage your VMware environments without the need to retrain staff or refactor the underlying hypervisors.

Create operational consistency for admins: Operational consistency is created for admins because you continue to use VMware solutions for resources running on Azure, including vSphere Client and NSX Manager. Admins have direct access to VMware solution interfaces. The Azure portal is used only for deployment and management operations.

Maintain operational consistency for the business: The service can reduce change management and maintain operational consistency for the business. You can use all of your organization's existing investments in:

 - Training

 - Process management

 - Change management

 - Tooling

You can accelerate migration and minimize downtime by using the latest VMware Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX) Enterprise functionality for large-scale, live migration from on-premises to Azure.

Have a single point of support: Azure VMware Solution is Microsoft developed, operated, and supported. Microsoft is the first and only contact and coordinates support with VMware as required.

Avoid licensing complexity: You work with a single vendor for licensing and resource consumption. You can track VMware product licensing directly with resource nodes as they're deployed and decommissioned.

Maximize the value of existing Windows Server and SQL Server licenses: You can use Azure Hybrid Benefit for both Windows Server and SQL Server to bring existing licenses to Azure and reduce costs.

## Integration with native Azure services

Azure VMware Solution gives customers options for migrating their VMware vSphere environment to the cloud at their own pace. Administrators use a single Azure portal interface with no connection to any third-party services. They develop cloud skills over time as they become familiar with Azure.
