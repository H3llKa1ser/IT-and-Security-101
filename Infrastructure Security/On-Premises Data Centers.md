# On-prem data centers

## When it comes to data centers, there are two primary options: organizations can outsource the data center or own the data center. If the data center is owned, it will likely be built on premises. A place, like a building for the data center is needed, along with power, HVAC, fire suppression and redundancy.

### 1) Data Center/Closets: The facility wiring infrastructure is integral to overall information system security and reliability. Protecting access to the physical layer of the network is important in minimizing intentional or unintentional damage. Proper protection of the physical site must address these sorts of security challenges. Data centers and wiring closets may include the following:

#### 1) Phone, network, special connections

#### 2) ISP or telecommunications provider equipment

#### 3) Servers

#### 4) Wiring and/or switch components

### 2) Heating, Ventilation and Air Contitioning (HVAC)/Environmental: High-density equipment and equipment within enclosed spaces requires adequate cooling and airflow. Well-established standards for the operation of computer equipment exist, and equipment is tested against these standards. For example, the recommended range for optimized maximum uptime and hardware life is from 64° to 81°F (18° to 27°C), and it is recommended that a rack have three temperature sensors, positioned at the top, middle and bottom of the rack, to measure the actual operating temperature of the environment. Proper management of data center temperatures, including cooling, is essential.

### Cooling is not the only issue with airflow: Contaminants like dust and noxious fumes require appropriate controls to minimize their impact on equipment. Monitoring for water or gas leaks, sewer overflow or HVAC failure should be integrated into the building control environment, with appropriate alarms to signal to organizational staff. Contingency planning to respond to the warnings should prioritize the systems in the building, so the impact of a major system failure on people, operations or other infrastructure can be minimized.

### 3) Power: Data centers and information systems in general consume a tremendous amount of electrical power, which needs to be delivered both constantly and consistently. Wide fluctuations in the quality of power affect system lifespan, while disruptions in supply completely stop system operations.

### Power at the site is always an integral part of data center operations. Regardless of fuel source, backup generators must be sized to provide for the critical load (the computing resources) and the supporting infrastructure. Similarly, battery backups must be properly sized to carry the critical load until generators start and stabilize. As with data backups, testing is necessary to ensure the failover to alternate power works properly.

### 4) Fire Suppression: For server rooms, appropriate fire detection/suppression must be considered based on the size of the room, typical human occupation, egress routes and risk of damage to equipment. For example, water used for fire suppression would cause more harm to servers and other electronic components. Gas-based fire suppression systems are more friendly to the electronics, but can be toxic to humans.
