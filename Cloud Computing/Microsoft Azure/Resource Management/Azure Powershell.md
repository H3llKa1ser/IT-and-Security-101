# Azure Powershell

Azure PowerShell is a shell with which developers, DevOps, and IT professionals can run commands called command-lets (cmdlets). These commands call the Azure REST API to perform management tasks in Azure. Cmdlets can be run independently to handle one-off changes, or they may be combined to help orchestrate complex actions such as:

1) The routine setup, teardown, and maintenance of a single resource or multiple connected resources.

2) The deployment of an entire infrastructure, which might contain dozens or hundreds of resources, from imperative code.

Capturing the commands in a script makes the process repeatable and automatable.

In addition to be available via Azure Cloud Shell, you can install and configure Azure PowerShell on Windows, Linux, and Mac platforms.
