### Backup types:

#### 1) Full Backup: The entire system is copied to backup media

#### 2) Differential Backup: Record differences in data since the most recent full backup

#### 3) Incremental Backup: Record changes that are made to the system on a daily basis

### Offsite Storage: Backups should be stored off site at a secure location

### Electronic vaulting: Allows backups across the internet to an offsite location
