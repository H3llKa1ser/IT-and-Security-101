# IP Convergence

### Using the Internet Protocol (IP) to transmit all of the information that transits a network

## BENEFITS

#### 1) Excellent support for Multimedia

#### 2) Devices can be run in innovative ways

#### 3) Easy to manage

#### 4) Fewer components

#### 5) Simplifies security management

## Technologies

### 1) Internet Small Computer System Interface (ISCSI): Facilitates data transfers over networks and manages storage over long distance. Links data storage facilities. Doesn't need cable.

### 2) Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS): Networking protocol for helping route packets from source to destination. The source router applies a "label" on how to get to the destination. Other routers just follow the label.

### 3) Voice over IP (VoIP): A technology that allows you to make voice calls over internet instead of a phone line. Video conferencing. Based on SIP (Session Initiation Protocol).

### 4) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): Manage multimedia connections. Supports encryptions and integrity.
