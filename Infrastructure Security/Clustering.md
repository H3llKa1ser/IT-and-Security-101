# Clustering

### Group of servers that are managed as a single system

### Higher availability, greater scalability, easier to manage instead of individual systems

### May provide redundancy, load balancing, or both

#### 1) Active/Active

#### 2) Active/Passive

### Cluster looks like a single server to the user (Example: Server farm)
