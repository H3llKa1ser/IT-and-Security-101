# Privileged Access Management (PAM)

### Privileged access management provides the first and perhaps most familiar use case. Consider a human user identity that is granted various create, read, update, and delete privileges on a database. Without privileged access management, the system’s access control would have those privileges assigned to the administrative user in a static way, effectively “on” 24 hours a day, every day. Security would be dependent upon the login process to prevent misuse of that identity. Just-in-time privileged access management, by contrast, includes role-based specific subsets of privileges that only become active in real time when the identity is requesting the use of a resource or service.
