# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

### IDS is a tool in a layered security model

#### 1) Identify suspicious activity

#### 2) Log activity

#### 3) Respond (alert people)

#### 4) Needs an interface in promiscuous mode

#### Can capture all traffic regardless of the destination address

#### 5) Sniffer + Analysis Engine = IDS

#### 6) Port Mirroring/Spanb needs to be enabled to view traffic on a switch

## IDS Categories

### 1) HIDS: Host-based Intrusion Detection System

### 2) NIDS: Network Intrusion Detection System

## IDS Components

### Both type of IDS have several components that make up the product:

### 1) Sensor - Data collector:

#### 1) On network segments (NIDS)

#### 2) On host (HIDS)

### 2) Analysis Engine (AE): Analyzes data collected by the sensor, determines if there is suspicious activity

### 3) Signature database: Used by the AE, defines signatures of previously known attacks

### 4) User interface and reporting: The way the system interacts with users
