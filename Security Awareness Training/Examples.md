# Security Awareness Training Examples

## Let’s look at an example of security awareness training by using an organization’s strategy to improve fire safety in the workplace: 

### 1) Education may help workers in a secure server room understand the interaction of the various fire and smoke detectors, suppression systems, alarms and their interactions with electrical power, lighting and ventilation systems. 

### 2) Training would provide those workers with task-specific, detailed learning about the proper actions each should take in the event of an alarm, a suppression system going off without an alarm, a ventilation system failure or other contingency. This training would build on the learning acquired via the educational activities. 

### 3) Awareness activities would include not only posting the appropriate signage, floor or doorway markings, but also other indicators to help workers detect an anomaly, respond to an alarm and take appropriate action. In this case, awareness is a constantly available reminder of what to do when the alarms go off. 

## Translating that into an anti-phishing campaign might be done by: 

### 1) Education may be used to help select groups of users better understand the ways in which social engineering attacks are conducted and engage those users in creating and testing their own strategies for improving their defensive techniques. 

### 2) Training will help users increase their proficiency in recognizing a potential phishing or similar attempt, while also helping them practice the correct responses to such events. Training may include simulated phishing emails sent to users on a network to test their ability to identify a phishing email.

### 3) Raising users’ overall awareness of the threat posed by phishing, vishing, SMS phishing (also called “smishing) and other social engineering tactics. Awareness techniques can also alert selected users to new or novel approaches that such attacks might be taking.
