# Certificate Acquisition: Client Certificate Request Flow

### 1) The request process begins with clients finding an Enterprise CA.

### 2) A CSR is created, containing a public key and other details, after generating a public-private key pair.

### 3) The CA assesses the CSR against available certificate templates, issuing the certificate based on the template's permissions.

### 4) Upon approval, the CA signs the certificate with its private key and returns it to the client.
