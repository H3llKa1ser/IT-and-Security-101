# Object Storage

### Object storage is a type of storage where data is stored as objects rather than in a hierarchical file structure. Each object typically includes the data itself, metadata, and a unique identifier.

### Protocols commonly used with object storage include:

 - Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) API

 - OpenStack Swift

 - Azure Blob Storage API

### Object storage is highly scalable and suitable for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as multimedia files, backups, and archives.
