# Penetration Testing

### Active, potentially intrusive process of simulating attacks on a network

## 3 Basic requirements

#### 1) Meet with Senior Management to determine the goal of the assessment

#### 2) Document Rules of Engagement (RoE)

#### 3) Get sign off from Senior Management

### Penetration testing uses a set of procedures and tools designed to test and possibly bypass the security controls of a system

### Goal is to measure an organization's level of resistance to an attack and to uncover any weaknesses within the environment

### Emulates the same methods attackers would use

### Penetration testing should only be conducted with senior management's approval in writing

# Penetration Testing Steps

### 1) Discovery: Footprinting and gathering information about the target

### 2) Enumeration: Performing port scans and resource identification methods

### 3) Vulnerability mapping: Identifying vulnerabilities in identified systems and resources

### 4) Exploitation: Attempting to gain unauthorized access by exploiting vulnerabilities

### 5) Report to Management: Delivering to management documentation of test findings along with suggested countermeasures

# Penetration testing modes:

### 1) White box

### 2) Grey box

### 3) Black box

## White box testing

### The testers perform tests with the knowledge of the security and IT staff

### They are given network blueprints, planned test times, and assistance from the organization

## PROS

#### 1) Good support from the organization 

#### 2) Fixes can occur quicker

#### 3) Good for testing incident response procedures

## CONS

#### 1) An inaccurate picture of the network is produced

## Grey box testing

### Involves giving some information to the penetration testing team

### Organizations use this approach when they want the focus of the testing to be on accessing system and not information discovery

## PROS

#### 1) Combines benefits of white and black box testing

#### 2) Allows for focused testing scenarios

## CONS

#### 1) Testing coverage may be limited

## Black box testing

### Testers generally perform unannounced tests that even security and IT staff may not know about

### The objective is to get into whatever they can, without causing harm

## PROS

#### 1) A good look of the organization's true responses

## CONS

#### 1) Staff might get their feelings hurt (?)
