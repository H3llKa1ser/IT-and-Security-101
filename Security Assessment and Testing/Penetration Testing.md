# Penetration Testing

### Active, potentially intrusive process of simulating attacks on a network

## 3 Basic requirements

#### 1) Meet with Senior Management to determine the goal of the assessment

#### 2) Document Rules of Engagement (RoE)

#### 3) Get sign off from Senior Management

### Penetration testing uses a set of procedures and tools designed to test and possibly bypass the security controls of a system

### Goal is to measure an organization's level of resistance to an attack and to uncover any weaknesses within the environment

### Emulates the same methods attackers would use

### Penetration testing should only be conducted with senior management's approval in writing
