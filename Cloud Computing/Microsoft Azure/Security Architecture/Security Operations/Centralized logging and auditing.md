## Logging and auditing in Microsoft cloud security benchmark

Microsoft cloud security benchmark provides guidance on designing logging capabilities, which is summarized in the following table. For more complete information about these controls, see Microsoft cloud security benchmark - Logging and threat detection

Please refer to Introduction to Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architecture and cloud security benchmark for more background on Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark.

In the summary below, we have included controls from the full baseline where:

1) Security controls were supported but not enabled by default

2) There was explicit guidance which contained action to be taken on the part of the customer

| **Control Number** | **Title**                                     | **Summary**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LT-3               | Enable logging for security investigation      | Enable logging for your cloud resources to meet the requirements for security incident investigations and security response and compliance purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| LT-4               | Enable network logging for security investigation | Enable logging for your network services to support network-related incident investigations, threat hunting, and security alert generation. The network logs may include logs from network services such as IP filtering, network and application firewall, DNS, flow monitoring and so on.                                                  |
| LT-5               | Centralize security log management and analysis | Centralize logging storage and analysis to enable correlation across log data. For each log source, ensure that you have assigned a data owner, access guidance, storage location, what tools are used to process and access the data, and data retention requirements. Use Cloud native SIEM if you don't have an existing SIEM solution, or aggregate logs/alerts into your existing SIEM. |
| LT-6               | Configure log storage retention                | Plan your log retention strategy according to your compliance, regulation, and business requirements. Configure the log retention policy at the individual logging services to ensure the logs are archived appropriately.                                                                                                                     |

## Centralized logging on Azure

The recommended logging guidance from MCSB on Azure is the following:

1) Ensure that you are integrating Azure activity logs into a centralized Log Analytics workspace.

2) Use Azure Monitor to query and perform analytics and create alert rules using the logs aggregated from Azure services, endpoint devices, network resources, and other security systems.

3) In addition, enable and onboard data to Microsoft Sentinel which provides the security information event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) capability.

## Azure Monitor overview

Azure Monitor is a comprehensive monitoring solution for collecting, analyzing, and responding to telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments. You can use Azure Monitor to maximize the availability and performance of your applications and services.

Azure Monitor collects and aggregates the data from every layer and component of your system into a common data platform. It correlates data across multiple Azure subscriptions and tenants, in addition to hosting data for other services. Because this data is stored together, it can be correlated and analyzed using a common set of tools. The data can then be used for analysis and visualizations to help you understand how your applications are performing and respond automatically to system events.

Azure Monitor also includes Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance, which allows you to move your on-premises System Center Operation Manager (Operations Manager) installation to the cloud in Azure.

Use Azure Monitor to monitor these types of resources in Azure, other clouds, or on-premises:

Applications

Virtual machines

Guest operating systems

Containers

Databases

Security events in combination with Azure Sentinel

Networking events and health in combination with Network Watcher

Custom sources that use the APIs to get data into Azure Monitor

Collect your Prometheus metrics with Azure Managed Prometheus and analyze them using PromQL in Azure Managed Grafana.

You can also export monitoring data from Azure Monitor into other systems so you can:

Integrate with other third-party and open-source monitoring and visualization tools

Integrate with ticketing and other ITSM systems

### High level architecture

The following diagram gives a high-level view of Azure Monitor.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb117bf7-1071-4ef1-8b2a-cee5e2565591)

The diagram depicts the Azure Monitor system components:

1) The data sources are the types of data collected from each monitored resource. The data is collected and routed to the data platform.

2) The data platform is made up of the data stores for collected data. Azure Monitor's data platform has stores for metrics, logs, traces, and changes.

3) The functions and components that consume data include analysis, visualizations, insights, and responses.

4) Services that integrate with Azure Monitor to provide additional functionality and are integrated throughout the system.

### Data sources

Azure Monitor can collect data from multiple sources, including from your application, operating systems, the services they rely on, and from the platform itself.

You can integrate monitoring data from sources outside Azure, including on-premises and other non-Microsoft clouds, using the application, infrastructure, and custom data sources.

Azure Monitor collects these types of data:

### Data platform

Azure Monitor stores data in data stores for each of the pillars of observability: metrics, logs, distributed traces, and changes. Each store is optimized for specific types of data and monitoring scenarios.

| **Pillar of Observability / Data Store** | **Description** |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Azure Monitor Metrics** | Metrics are numerical values that describe an aspect of a system at a particular point in time. Azure Monitor Metrics is a time-series database, optimized for analyzing time-stamped data. Azure Monitor collects metrics at regular intervals. Metrics are identified with a timestamp, a name, a value, and one or more defining labels. They can be aggregated using algorithms, compared to other metrics, and analyzed for trends over time. It supports native Azure Monitor metrics and Prometheus metrics. |
| **Azure Monitor Logs** | Logs are recorded system events. Logs can contain different types of data, be structured or free-form text, and they contain a timestamp. Azure Monitor stores structured and unstructured log data of all types in Azure Monitor Logs. You can route data to Log Analytics workspaces for querying and analysis. |
| **Traces** | Distributed traces identify the series of related events that follow a user request through a distributed system. A trace measures the operation and performance of your application across the entire set of components in your system. Traces can be used to determine the behavior of application code and the performance of different transactions. Azure Monitor gets distributed trace data from the Application Insights SDK. The trace data is stored in a separate workspace in Azure Monitor Logs. |
| **Changes** | Changes are a series of events in your application and resources. They're tracked and stored when you use the Change Analysis service, which uses Azure Resource Graph as its store. Change Analysis helps you understand which changes, such as deploying updated code, may have caused issues in your systems. |

# Auditing solutions in Microsoft Purview

Microsoft Purview auditing solutions provide an integrated solution to help organizations effectively respond to security events, forensic investigations, internal investigations, and compliance obligations. Thousands of user and admin operations performed in dozens of Microsoft 365 services and solutions are captured, recorded, and retained in your organization's unified audit log. Audit records for these events are searchable by security ops, IT admins, insider risk teams, and compliance and legal investigators in your organization. This capability provides visibility into the activities performed across your Microsoft 365 organization.

## Auditing features

Microsoft Purview Audit (Standard) provides with you with the ability to log and search for audited activities and power your forensic, IT, compliance, and legal investigations.

Enabled by default. Audit (Standard) is turned on by default for all organizations with the appropriate subscription. That means records for audited activities are captured and searchable. The only setup that required is to assign the necessary permissions to access the audit log search tool (and the corresponding cmdlet) and make sure that user's are assigned the right license for Microsoft Purview Audit (Premium) features.

Thousands of searchable audit events. You can search for a wide-range of audited activities that occur is most of the Microsoft 365 services in your organization. For a list of the activities you can search for, see Audit log activities. For a list of the services and features that support audited activities, see Audit log record type.

Audit search tool in the Microsoft Purview portal or the compliance portal. Use the Audit log search tool in the portals to search for audit records. You can search for specific activities, for activities performed by specific users, and activities that occurred with a date range.

Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet. You can also use the Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell (the underlying cmdlet for the search tool) to search for audit events or to use in a script. For more information, see:

Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet reference
Use a PowerShell script to search the audit log
Export audit records to a CSV file. After running the Audit log search tool in the Microsoft Purview portal or the compliance portal, you can export the audit records returned by the search to a CSV file. This lets you use Microsoft Excel sort and filter on different audit record properties. You can also use Excel Power Query transform functionality to split each property in the AuditData JSON object into its own column. This lets you effectively view and compare similar data for different events. For more information, see Export, configure, and view audit log records.

Access to audit logs via Office 365 Management Activity API. A third method for accessing and retrieving audit records is to use the Office 365 Management Activity API. This lets organizations retain auditing data for longer periods than the default 180 days and lets them import their auditing data to a SIEM solution. For more information, see Office 365 Management Activity API reference.

180-day audit log retention. When an audited activity is performed by a user or admin, an audit record is generated and stored in the audit log for your organization. In Audit (Standard), records are retained for 180 days, which means you can search for activities that occurred within the past six months.
