# Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)

### PCI-DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. It is a set of security standards designed to ensure that companies that process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. The PCI-DSS was developed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), which was founded by major credit card companies such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, and JCB International.

### Here are the key components of the PCI-DSS:

1. **Build and Maintain a Secure Network**:
   - Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data.
   - Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.

2. **Protect Cardholder Data**:
   - Protect stored cardholder data.
   - Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.

3. **Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program**:
   - Use and regularly update antivirus software or programs.
   - Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.

4. **Implement Strong Access Control Measures**:
   - Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know.
   - Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access.
   - Restrict physical access to cardholder data.

5. **Regularly Monitor and Test Networks**:
   - Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data.
   - Regularly test security systems and processes.

6. **Maintain an Information Security Policy**:
   - Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel.

### Compliance with PCI-DSS is mandatory for any organization that stores, processes, or transmits credit card data. Compliance requirements vary depending on the number of transactions processed annually and the level of risk associated with the organization's operations. Non-compliance can result in fines, penalties, and other consequences imposed by credit card companies or regulatory authorities.

### Organizations subject to PCI-DSS compliance may undergo regular assessments and audits to verify compliance with the standard. Compliance validation methods include self-assessment questionnaires, external vulnerability scans, and on-site audits conducted by Qualified Security Assessors (QSAs).

### Overall, PCI-DSS aims to protect cardholder data and enhance payment card security by establishing a common set of security requirements for organizations involved in payment card processing. Compliance with PCI-DSS helps to reduce the risk of data breaches, fraud, and other security incidents involving payment card information.
