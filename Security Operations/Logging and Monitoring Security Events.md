# Logging and Monitoring Security Events

### Logging is the primary form of instrumentation that attempts to capture signals generated by events. Events are any actions that take place within the systems environment and cause measurable or observable change in one or more elements or resources within the system. Logging imposes a computational cost but is invaluable when determining accountability. Proper design of logging environments and regular log reviews remain best practices regardless of the type of computer system. 

### Major controls frameworks emphasize the importance of organizational logging practices. Information that may be relevant to being recorded and reviewed include (but is not limited to): 

#### 1) User IDs

#### 2) System activities

#### 3) Dates/times of key events (logoff and logon events)

#### 4) Device and location identity

#### 5) Successful and rejected system and resource access attempts

#### 6) system configuration changes and system protection activation and deactivation events 

###  Logging and monitoring the health of the information environment is essential to identifying inefficient or improperly performing systems, detecting compromises and providing a record of how systems are used. Robust logging practices provide tools to effectively correlate information from diverse systems to fully understand the relationship between one activity and another. 

### Log reviews are an essential function not only for security assessment and testing but also for identifying security incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activities and operational problems near the time of occurrence. Log reviews support audits – forensic analysis related to internal and external investigations – and provide support for organizational security baselines. Review of historic audit logs can determine if a vulnerability identified in a system has been previously exploited. 

### It is helpful for an organization to create components of a log management infrastructure and determine how these components interact. This aids in preserving the integrity of log data from accidental or intentional modification or deletion and in maintaining the confidentiality of log data. 

### Controls are implemented to protect against unauthorized changes to log information. Operational problems with the logging facility are often related to alterations to the messages that are recorded, log files being edited or deleted, and storage capacity of log file media being exceeded. Organizations must maintain adherence to retention policy for logs as prescribed by law, regulations and corporate governance. Since attackers want to hide the evidence of their attack, the organization’s policies and procedures should also address the preservation of original logs. Additionally, the logs contain valuable and sensitive information about the organization.  Appropriate measures must be taken to protect the log data from malicious use.
