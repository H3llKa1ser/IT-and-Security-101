### Provides Layer 2 framing for dial up. Needs other protocols for security.

### 1) Authentication 

### 2) PAP (Password Access Protocol): Clear Text

### 3) CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol): Client responds to a challenge from the server. The only way the client can answer correctly is if the correct password has been entered.

### 4) EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol): Extends the capabilities beyond passwords, to smart cards, biometrics, token devices, etc.
