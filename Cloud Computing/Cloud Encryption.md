# Cloud Encryption

### Encryption implementation at various phases:

#### 1) Data in Motion: IPSEC, SSL/TLS

#### 2) Data at Rest

#### 3) Data in Use

### Components of cloud encryption

#### 1) Data which needs to be encrypted

#### 2) Encryption Engine

#### 3) Encrypting keys

## Data Encryption in IaaS

### It is necessary to be responsible for encryption in IaaS

### Volume Storage Encryption

#### 1) Instance-based: The encryption engine is located in the instance

#### 2) Proxy-based: Encryption is used on a proxy appliance

### Object Storage Encryption

#### 1) File-level encryption: Files are encrypted

#### 2) Application-level encryption: Encryption engine is in the application

# More approaches to data protection

### Data masking/obfuscation

#### 1) Random substitution: A value is replaced with a random value

#### 2) Shuffle: Moves order of values

#### 3) Making: Hiding certain parts of the data

#### 4) Deletion: Removing the data

### Data anonymization: Personal information is removed

### Tokenization: Substituting a sensitive data element for a non-sensitive one
