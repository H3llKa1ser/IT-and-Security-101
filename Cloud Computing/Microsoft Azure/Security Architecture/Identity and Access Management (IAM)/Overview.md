Identity provides the basis for a wide variety of security assurance. It grants access based on identity authentication and authorization controls in cloud services. Access control protects data and resources and helps decide which requests should be permitted.

Identity and access management is boundary security in the public cloud. It must be treated as the foundation of any secure and fully compliant public cloud architecture. Azure offers a comprehensive set of services, tools, and reference architectures to help organizations make highly secure, operationally efficient environments.
