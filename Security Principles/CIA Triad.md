# CIA Triad

### CIA Stands for: 

#### 1) Confidentiality

#### 2) Integrity

#### 3) Availability

## Brief explanation

#### 1) Confidentiality relates to permitting authorized access to information, while at the same time protecting information from improper disclosure

#### 2) Integrity is the property of information whereby it is recorded, used and maintained in a way that ensures its completeness, accuracy, internal consistency and usefulness for a stated purpose

#### 3) Availability means that systems and data are accessible at the time users need them

## Deep Dive

#### 1) Confidentiality: Confidentiality is a difficult balance to achieve when many system users are guests or customers, and it is not known if they are accessing the system from a compromised machine or vulnerable mobile application. So, the security professional’s obligation is to regulate access—protect the data that needs protection, yet permit access to authorized individuals.

#### Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is a term related to the area of confidentiality. It pertains to any data about an individual that could be used to identify them. Other terms related to confidentiality are protected health information (PHI) , which is information regarding one’s health status, and classified or sensitive information, which includes trade secrets, research, business plans and intellectual property.

#### Another useful definition is sensitivity, which is a measure of the importance assigned to information by its owner, or the purpose of denoting its need for protection. Sensitive information is information that if improperly disclosed (confidentiality) or modified (integrity) would harm an organization or individual. In many cases, sensitivity is related to the harm to external stakeholders; that is, people or organizations that may not be a part of the organization that processes or uses the information
