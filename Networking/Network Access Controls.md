# Network Access Controls

### Boundary Router: Advertise routes that external hosts can use ti reach internal hosts. Can also filter traffic. Prevents spoofing.

### Security Perimeter: The first line of protection between trusted and untrusted networks. Firewalls and IDS systems.

### Network Partitioning: Segmenting networks into different areas.

### Dual-Homed Host: Has two NICs on a separate network. (Network Interface Card)

### Bastion Host: A highly exposed device that will most likely be targeted for attacks.

### Demilitarized Zone (DMZ): Area between firewalls. Servers are placed here to give external hosts access to some resources.
