# Secure Development Methodologies

## Waterfall

### It trinkles down in order to:

#### 1) Requirements

#### 2) System Design

#### 3) Implementation

#### 4) Integration

#### 5) Deployment

#### 6) Maintenance

## Remember! It's a one way methodology. Once you go down, you can't go up!

## Waterfall Steps in detail:

### 1) Requirements Gathering and Analysis

#### Functional and Non-Functional Requirements are documented

#### Security requirements are defined

### 2) System Design

#### Requirements are turned into flow charts and narratives

#### Design walkthroughs are held to ensure all requirements are there

### 3) Implementation

#### Programming is done and modules are created

#### The security practitioner is responsible for the correct implementation of security concepts

### 4) Integration

#### Modules are combined and tested

### 5) Deployment of System

#### The application is sent to a controlled environment for quality assurance

#### The application is then put into production

### 6) Maintenance

#### Bugs and vulnerabilities are patched when they arise

## Spiral Model

### Based on the waterfall development model, but adds a PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) sequence at each stage of the progression

## Rapid Application Development (RAD)

### Designed to quickly build user interface components as requirements are gathered

## Agile 

### Relies on feedback from application users and development teams as their primary control mechanism

### TIP: You can go down or up or in a loop of the steps as many times as needed to.
