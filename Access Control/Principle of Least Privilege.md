# Principle of Least Privilege

### The Principle of Least Privilege is a standard of permitting only minimum access necessary for users or programs to fulfill their function. Users are provided access only to the systems and programs they need to perform their specific job or tasks. 

## Examples:

### To preserve the confidentiality of information and ensure that it is only available to personnel who are authorized to see it, we use privileged access management, which is based on the principle of least privilege. That means each user is granted access only to the items they need and nothing further.  

### For example, only individuals working in billing will be allowed to view consumer financial data, and even fewer individuals will have the authority to change or delete that data. This maintains confidentiality and integrity while also allowing availability by providing administrative access with an appropriate password or sign-on that proves the user has the appropriate permissions to access that data.  

### Sometimes it is necessary to allow users to access the information via a temporary or limited access, for instance, for a specific time period or just within normal business hours. Or access rules can limit the fields that the individuals can have access to. One example is a healthcare environment. Some workers might have access to patient data but not their medical data. Individual doctors might have access only to data related to their own patients. In some cases, this is regulated by law, such as HIPAA in the United States, and by specific privacy laws in other countries. 

### Systems often monitor access to private information, and if logs indicate that someone has attempted to access a database without the proper permissions, that will automatically trigger an alarm. The security administrator will then record the incident and alert the appropriate people to take action.  

### The more critical information a person has access to, the greater the security should be around that access. They should definitely have multi-factor authentication, for instance.
