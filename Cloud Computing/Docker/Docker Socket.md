# Docker Socket

When you install Docker, there are two programs that get installed:

1) The Docker Client

2) The Docker Server

Docker works in a client/server model. Specifically, these two programs communicate with each other to form the Docker. Docker achieves this communication using something called a socket. Sockets are an essential feature of the operating system that allows data to be communicated.
