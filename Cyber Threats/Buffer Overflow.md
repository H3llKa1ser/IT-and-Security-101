# Buffer Overflow

### A buffer overflow attack is a type of security vulnerability where a program writes more data to a buffer, or temporary data storage area, than it can hold. This extra data can overflow into adjacent memory locations, causing unintended consequences such as corrupting or overwriting other data, crashing the program, or even executing arbitrary code. 

### Buffer overflow attacks are often used by hackers to exploit software vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to a system or to execute malicious code. They can be particularly dangerous because they can lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to take control of the affected system.

### To prevent buffer overflow attacks, developers can use secure coding practices such as input validation, bounds checking, and using secure libraries that handle memory management safely. Additionally, operating systems and programming languages have built-in protections, such as address space layout randomization (ASLR) and stack canaries, to make buffer overflow attacks more difficult to execute.
